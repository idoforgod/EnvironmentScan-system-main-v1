## Classification Rules

### Priority Order
1. If signal involves **ethics or psychology** → **s (spiritual)**
2. If signal is about **law or regulation** → **P (Political)**
3. If signal is **technology innovation** → **T (Technological)**
4. If signal is about **climate or environment** → **E (Environmental)**
5. If signal is about **economy or markets** → **E (Economic)**
6. If signal is about **society** (but not ethics) → **S (Social)**

### Ambiguous Cases

**"AI governance regulation"**
- Primary: **P (Political)** - because it's about regulation
- Secondary: s (spiritual) - ethics aspect
- Choose: **P**

**"Climate protests by youth activists"**
- Could be: E (Environmental) OR S (Social)
- Choose: **S (Social)** - focus on social movement

**"Tech workers demand ethical AI"**
- Could be: T (Technological) OR s (spiritual)
- Choose: **s (spiritual)** - focus on ethics

**"Carbon tax policy"**
- Could be: P (Political) OR E (Environmental)
- Choose: **P (Political)** - it's a policy/regulation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Wrong**: Classifying "AI ethics debate" as **T** (Technology)
✅ **Right**: Classify as **s** (spiritual) - it's about ethics

❌ **Wrong**: Creating new category "Legal" for laws
✅ **Right**: Laws belong to **P** (Political)

❌ **Wrong**: Splitting Environmental into "Climate" and "Resources"
✅ **Right**: Keep as single **E** (Environmental) category

❌ **Wrong**: Classifying "public anxiety about AI" as **S** (Social)
✅ **Right**: Classify as **s** (spiritual) - it's psychology
