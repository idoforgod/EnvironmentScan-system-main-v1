# Source Exploration Frontiers — Random Discovery Keywords
# Version: 1.0.0
# Last Updated: 2026-02-12
#
# Used by discovery-beta for serendipitous source discovery.
# SIE may add/remove keywords based on discovery success rates (MINOR change).
# Keywords are sampled randomly (or weighted-randomly) at each scan.
