# WF2 Exclusive: arXiv Academic Deep Scanning Source Configuration
# Version: 1.0.0
# Last Updated: 2026-02-03
#
# This file is used ONLY by WF2 (arXiv dedicated workflow).
# It contains a single source: arXiv, with extended parameters for deep scanning.
#
# Differences from WF1's arXiv config:
#   - days_back: 14 (vs WF1's 7)
#   - max_results: 50 per category (vs WF1's 20)
#   - timeout: 60s (vs WF1's 30s)
#   - Extended arXiv category mappings for broader academic coverage
#   - critical: true (arXiv is the sole source; failure halts WF2)
