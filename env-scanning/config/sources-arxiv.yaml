# WF2 Exclusive: arXiv Academic Deep Scanning Source Configuration
# Version: 2.0.0
# Last Updated: 2026-02-12
#
# This file is used ONLY by WF2 (arXiv dedicated workflow).
# It contains a single source: arXiv, with FULL category coverage.
#
# v2.0.0 Changes (2026-02-12):
#   - Expanded from 36 categories to ALL ~180 arXiv categories
#   - Reorganized into 20 query groups by arXiv archive
#   - Each category has explicit primary STEEPs mapping
#   - Scanner reads query_groups directly (no more hardcoded mapping)
#   - API-level date filtering via submittedDate parameter
#
# Design Principle:
#   "arXiv 사이트의 분류항목을 빠짐없이 다 돌아다니며 스캐닝"
#   — 모든 학문 분야의 초기 변화 시그널을 포착하기 위해 전체 카테고리를 커버한다.

    # QUERY GROUPS — Organized by arXiv archive for API efficiency
    # ================================================================
    # Each group = 1 API call. ~20 groups × 3s rate limit ≈ 60 seconds total.
    # Papers are assigned primary STEEPs based on category_steeps_mapping below.
    # Cross-group dedup is performed after collection.
