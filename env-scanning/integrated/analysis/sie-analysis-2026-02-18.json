    "summary": "The 2026-02-18 scan represents one of the strongest operational days in system history. All 3 workflows completed successfully with zero validation failures and zero retries. WF1 produced 47 signals (highest recent count) with 6/6 STEEPs coverage. WF2 processed 475 papers consistently. WF3 achieved all 8 FSSF types for the first time. Integration balanced WF1 (9) and WF3 (8) representation well. The new dedup gate (v2.6.0) operated without issues on its first day. The only persistent concern is pSST score compression (W2, moderate) and the source exploration zero-candidate streak (3 scans).",
