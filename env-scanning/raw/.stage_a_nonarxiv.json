Both EFP applicants request exemptions from regulatory provisions pertaining to the use of authorized gear types under the Fishery Management Plan for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS FMP). The applicants propose to test the effects and efficacy of using alternative fishing practices to harvest swordfish and other HMS off of the U.S. West Coast. During the November 2025 Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) meeting, the Council reviewed and endorsed these two EFP applications and recommended that NMFS approve them. NMFS has determined that these applications warrant further consideration and is requesting public comment on them, as well as the Council's recommendations on them.",
