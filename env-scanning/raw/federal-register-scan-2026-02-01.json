      "abstract": "The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2024-24-10, which applies to certain Airbus SAS Model A318 and Model A320 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, - 132, -133, -151N, -153N, and 171N airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, -251NX, -252N, -252NX, - 253N, -253NX, -271N, -271NX, -272N, and -272NX airplanes. AD 2024-24-10 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-24-10, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require certain actions in AD 2024- 24-10 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This proposed AD would also add Model A319- 173N and Model A321-253NY airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

The BLM is proposing to revise the regulations to allow for commingling of production more broadly to promote oil and gas production on Federal, Indian, private and State lands. Commingling of production can reduce an operator's cost which could extend the economic life of a well, thereby allowing the operator to continue producing from a well that might otherwise be abandoned.",

These changes include establishing new loan limits for graduate students, professional students, and parents, and phasing out the Graduate PLUS Program. The Department notes that the term \"professional student\" as used in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) is intended solely to distinguish those programs that we propose would be eligible for higher loan limits, as required by the OBBB. The designation, or lack thereof, of a program as \"professional\" does not reflect a value judgment by the Department regarding whether a borrower graduating from the program is considered a \"professional.\" This NPRM only interprets the phrase \"professional student\" as used in the context of the loan limits established by the OBBB. The OBBB also simplifies the current broken and confusing myriad of Federal student loan repayment plans by phasing out the existing Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plans, creating a new tiered standard repayment plan option, and implementing a new income-driven repayment plan known as the Repayment Assistant Plan. The OBBB also enables borrowers in default who have previously rehabilitated a defaulted loan a second chance to rehabilitate their loan(s) and resume repayment.",

These disclosures are needed so that fiduciaries can assess the reasonableness of the contracts or arrangements with these service providers, including the reasonableness of the service providers' compensation. These disclosure requirements would apply for purposes of ERISA's statutory prohibited transaction exemption for services arrangements. This proposal implements section 12 of President Trump's Executive Order 14273, Lowering Drug Prices by Once Again Putting Americans First, which instructs the Department to propose regulations to improve employer health plan transparency into the direct and indirect compensation received by pharmacy benefit managers. If finalized, this regulation would affect sponsors and other fiduciaries of self-insured group health plans and certain service providers to such plans.",

      "abstract": "The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB-BK117 D-3 helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of excessive wear on the bearing bolts, installed on the swashplate, connecting the cardan ring and the control ring assembly. This AD requires initial and repetitive inspections of the swashplate for vertical and radial play and, depending on the results of the inspections, corrective actions. This AD also prohibits installing any affected bolt unless the bolts are new or certain requirements are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
