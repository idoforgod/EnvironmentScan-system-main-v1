This guidance establishes a rubric which allows OWCP to adjust the insurance carriers' obligations based on their fiscal stability and performance within the Longshore industry and serves to establish a clear and standardized process for determining the amount of collateral an authorized insurance carrier must deposit to cover its potential liabilities. This clarification benefits insurance carriers by providing predictability which aids in capital planning and avoids arbitrary or unexpected security adjustments. This also helps to standardize compliance across the industry and ensures authorized carriers secure their critical obligations. This sub-regulatory guidance does not supersede existing regulations and is intended to provide insurance carriers (carriers) with clarification on the posting of security deposits to collateralize liabilities.",

This notice also provides the public an opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene (i.e., contested hearing) with respect to that application. If the NRC issues an ESP, the applicant, Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, would be approved for one or more proposed sites for a nuclear power facility, independent of a specific nuclear plant design or an application for a construction permit or combined license.
