The proposed rule identifies the parties that would be eligible to transmit vessel EEM information and their responsibilities, and the time frames for transmission of the information prior to cargo loading or conveyance departure. Requiring advance transmission of EEM data would significantly improve cargo safety and security while minimizing disruption to the flow of commerce for exports in the sea environment.",
