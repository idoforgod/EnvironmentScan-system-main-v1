This final rule does make some minor modifications to the 2020 Rule to further streamline the process for OSM's coordination with State regulatory authorities, minimize duplication of efforts in the administration of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (\"SMCRA\" or \"the Act\"), and appropriately recognize that State regulatory authorities are the primary regulatory authorities for non- Federal, non-Indian lands within their borders.",

DOE has determined that revisions to the PEF are necessary. DOE is first publishing a final rule that removes the fuel content factor (FCF) from the calculation of the PEF. Removal of the FCF is consistent with a United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit decision that held, among other things, that the inclusion of the FCF in the PEF calculation exceeded DOE's authority under the substantive statute. DOE will propose additional revisions to the PEF in a forthcoming notice of proposed rulemaking.",

The magnitude of unprecedented and destructive wildfires and other threats to forest health over the last decade, approaches to management (including the barred owl management), and severely reduced timber production compared to historically higher levels (and its resulting adverse economic consequences) merit consideration in an RMP revision.
