### 2. LvD: A New Algorithm for Computing the Likelihood of a Phylogeny

- **Category**: E
- **Priority Score**: 4.90
- **Published**: 2026-01-27
- **Source**: [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19064v1)

**Abstract**: There are few, if any, algorithms in statistical phylogenetics which are used more heavily than Felsenstein's 1973 pruning method for computing the likelihood of a tree. We present LvD, (Likelihood vi...

### 6. The quenched structured coalescent for diploid population models on finite graphs with large migrations and uneven offspring distributions

- **Category**: E
- **Priority Score**: 4.77
- **Published**: 2026-01-28
- **Source**: [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21079v1)

**Abstract**: In this work we describe a new model for the evolution of a diploid structured population backwards in time that allows for large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. The model generalizes b...
