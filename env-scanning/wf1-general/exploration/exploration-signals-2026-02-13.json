        "abstract": "The World Inequality Report 2026, edited by Lucas Chancel, Ricardo Gomez-Carrera, Rowaida Moshrif, and Thomas Piketty, reveals that global inequality persists at very extreme levels. The top 10% of the global population owns three-quarters (75%) of global wealth, while the bottom half holds only 2%. Carbon inequality mirrors wealth inequality: the poorest half accounts for only 3% of carbon emissions associated with private capital ownership, while the top 10% accounts for 77%. The report explores new dimensions including climate inequality, gender disparities, unequal access to human capital, asymmetries in the global financial system, and territorial divides reshaping democracies. It proposes a global taxation framework for multi-millionaires as a potential remedy.",

Researchers warn these tools are developed 'with the promise of improving creativity or having social benefit — so if they are not helping, that has important implications.'
