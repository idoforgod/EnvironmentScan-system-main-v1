The conference will address breakthroughs in research, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions that affect women across the lifespan. It will explore opportunities to bridge gaps between evidence and implementation and drive cross-sector innovation to modernize patient care and promote better health. The National Conference on Women's Health co-sponsorship will involve executing a series of financially self-sustaining meetings, events, and/or conference networking opportunities to convene women's health stakeholders and facilitate discussions on health topics that impact women and girls. HHS will be responsible for arranging and paying for conference facilities, logistics, and advertising. Co- sponsors will be responsible for developing programming for and managing logistics of co-sponsored meetings, events, and/or conference networking opportunities and shall consult with HHS and receive HHS approval prior to finalizing such opportunities. Co-sponsors will be responsible for paying for expenses related to and advertising the co- sponsored meetings, events, and/or conference networking opportunities. No federal funds will be provided to the co-sponsor. Registration fees will not be collected for the conference or co-sponsored activities. This co-sponsorship opportunity is not a grant or contract award, and each entity will be responsible for financially supporting its own activities. Potential co-sponsors must be capable of managing the day- to-day operations associated with the proposed activities in collaboration with the conference organizers and be willing to participate substantively in the execution of the co-sponsored activity(ies). Participation by co-sponsor(s) does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",

The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on September 23, 2025. The collection involves inputting minimal information into a database to register small, unmanned aircraft. Aircraft registration is necessary to ensure personal accountability among all users of the National Airspace System (NAS). Aircraft registration also allows the FAA and law enforcement agencies to address non-compliance by providing the means for identifying an aircraft's owner and operator. This collection also permits individuals to de-register or update their record in the registration database.",

        "abstract": "We, the Fish and Wildlife Service, announce receipt of applications from Joseph Pianalto, Jeffrey W. Floyd, and Robert Holzberger (applicants) for separate incidental take permits (ITP), pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Environmental Policy Act under the approved general conservation plan (GCP) and final environmental impact statement for the Alabama beach mouse. A GCP is a mechanism that meets the definition of a conservation plan in section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA and enables the construction of a programmatic permitting and conservation process to address a defined suite of proposed activities over a defined planning area. Each applicant requests an ITP to take the federally listed Alabama beach mouse incidental to the construction of a single-family home in Baldwin County, Alabama. We invite public comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.",
