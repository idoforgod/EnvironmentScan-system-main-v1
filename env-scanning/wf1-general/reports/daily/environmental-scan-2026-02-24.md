### Priority 1: New START Nuclear Treaty Expires: US-Russia Without Bilateral Arms Control for First Time in 50+ Years

- **Confidence**: pSST 92 (Grade A)

1. **Classification**: Political (P) — International security, arms control, geopolitics
2. **Source**: Council on Foreign Relations / Brookings Institution — Published 2026-02-24
3. **Key Facts**: The New START treaty between Russia and the United States expired in February 2026. This nuclear arms treaty was the last remaining bilateral arms control agreement between the two countries. Its expiration leaves both nations without binding limits on strategic nuclear weapons deployment for the first time since the early 1970s.
4. **Quantitative Metrics**: 50+ years of continuous bilateral arms control ended. New START limited each side to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads and 700 deployed delivery systems. Without a successor, the two nations possess ~90% of the world's nuclear warheads (estimated 12,000+ combined).
5. **Impact**: Extreme — Creates unprecedented nuclear escalation risk, incentivizes arms racing, undermines the entire Non-Proliferation Treaty regime, and could trigger cascade of other nations increasing nuclear programs
6. **Detailed Description**: The expiration of New START represents the dissolution of a cornerstone of the post-Cold War international security architecture. The treaty had served as the primary mechanism for limiting strategic nuclear arsenals and providing verification mechanisms including on-site inspections. Without a successor agreement, both nations are unconstrained in deploying strategic nuclear weapons. Negotiations for a replacement were stalled by the Russia-Ukraine war (now in its fourth year) and disagreements over verification scope. This creates a dangerous uncertainty period where neither side can verify the other's nuclear posture.
7. **Inference**: The collapse of bilateral arms control will likely catalyze a broader erosion of the non-proliferation regime. States that relied on US extended deterrence may reconsider independent nuclear programs. Simultaneously, China's growing arsenal adds a tripartite dimension that makes any new treaty far more complex. Expect increased defense spending and potential nuclear modernization acceleration in both the US and Russia.
8. **Stakeholders**: All nuclear and non-nuclear nations, NATO allies, UN Security Council, IAEA, defense industries, civilian populations in nuclear states, arms control research community
9. **Monitoring Indicators**: Any new bilateral or trilateral negotiation framework announcements; changes in nuclear deployment patterns; defense budget allocations for nuclear modernization; statements from other nuclear states (China, UK, France) on arsenal policies

### Priority 2: Triplet Superconductor Discovery Opens Path to Zero-Power Quantum Computing

- **Confidence**: pSST 88 (Grade B)

1. **Classification**: Technological (T) — Materials science, quantum computing, energy efficiency
2. **Source**: ScienceDaily — Published 2026-02-21
3. **Key Facts**: Researchers have discovered signs of a rare triplet superconductor — a material capable of transmitting both electricity and spin signals with zero energy loss, potentially enabling ultra-fast quantum computers that operate on nearly zero power.
4. **Quantitative Metrics**: Zero energy loss for both electrical and spin signal transmission. Current quantum computers require cooling to near absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius) at enormous energy cost. This discovery could reduce quantum computing energy requirements by orders of magnitude.
5. **Impact**: Very High — Could fundamentally reshape the quantum computing hardware landscape, making quantum advantage practical and energy-efficient
6. **Detailed Description**: Triplet superconductors are an extremely rare class of materials where paired electrons carry aligned spins, enabling simultaneous transmission of charge and spin information without resistance. Unlike conventional (singlet) superconductors used in current quantum computers, triplet superconductors maintain spin coherence, which is essential for quantum information processing. This discovery addresses one of the biggest barriers to practical quantum computing: the extreme energy requirements for cooling. If the material can be engineered at scale, it could enable room-temperature or near-room-temperature quantum processors.
7. **Inference**: This discovery, combined with IBM's declaration that 2026 marks quantum advantage over classical computing, suggests the quantum computing inflection point may be closer than expected. Industries that can benefit from quantum optimization (pharmaceuticals, finance, logistics) should begin preparing transition strategies. The materials science implications extend beyond computing into energy transmission and sensing.
8. **Stakeholders**: Quantum computing companies (IBM, Google, Quantinuum, Atom Computing), semiconductor manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, financial institutions, national laboratories, materials science researchers
9. **Monitoring Indicators**: Peer-reviewed replication studies; patent filings on triplet superconductor fabrication; IBM quantum advantage demonstration results; commercial quantum computing availability timelines

### Priority 3: Planet Conclusively Expected to Breach 1.5 Degree Celsius Barrier Within 3-5 Years

- **Confidence**: pSST 87 (Grade B)

1. **Classification**: Environmental (E_Environmental) — Climate change, Paris Agreement, adaptation
2. **Source**: Yale Climate Connections / Carbon Brief — Published 2026-02-23
3. **Key Facts**: Scientists project that the planet will conclusively breach the 1.5 degree Celsius warming barrier within the next 3-5 years. This threshold was the more ambitious target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement.
4. **Quantitative Metrics**: 1.5 degree Celsius threshold breach expected by 2029-2031. Current warming already at approximately 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 2025 recorded as hottest year ever measured. CO2 concentrations continue to rise above 420 ppm.
5. **Impact**: Extreme — Triggers cascading effects across ecosystems, agriculture, insurance, migration, and geopolitics; accelerates tipping point cascades
6. **Detailed Description**: The 1.5 degree threshold represents not merely a number but a boundary beyond which several Earth system tipping points become increasingly probable: collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, dieback of the Amazon rainforest, and disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The scientific consensus now frames 1.5 degree breach as near-certain rather than avoidable. This shifts the policy discourse from mitigation alone to a combined mitigation-adaptation paradigm. Insurance markets, agricultural planning, and urban infrastructure must now adapt to a higher-warming baseline.
7. **Inference**: Expect accelerated climate finance mobilization (the EU CBAM is already in effect), increased climate litigation, and growing pressure on high-emission industries. Developing nations will push harder for loss and damage financing at upcoming climate negotiations. Adaptation technology and climate resilience infrastructure become high-growth sectors.
8. **Stakeholders**: All nations (particularly small island developing states), insurance industry, agricultural sector, climate finance institutions, fossil fuel industry, renewable energy companies, UNFCCC
9. **Monitoring Indicators**: Global mean temperature anomaly measurements; Arctic sea ice extent; AMOC strength indicators; climate finance commitments; national adaptation plan submissions

### Priority 4: WHO Warns Global Health Systems 'At Risk' as International Aid Funding Cuts Bite

- **Confidence**: pSST 85 (Grade B)

1. **Classification**: Social (S) — Global health, development, demographics
2. **Source**: UN News / WHO — Published 2026-02-23
3. **Key Facts**: WHO warns that cuts to international aid and persistent funding gaps are undermining the global health system. Sudden severe cuts to bilateral aid have caused huge disruptions to health systems and services in many countries.
4. **Quantitative Metrics**: WHO launched a $1 billion 2026 appeal for 36 emergencies worldwide. Global health worker shortages estimated at 10+ million. Funding cuts affect pandemic preparedness, AMR response, and routine immunization programs.
5. **Impact**: Very High — Weakened health systems increase pandemic risk, child mortality, and antimicrobial resistance spread
6. **Detailed Description**: The WHO Director-General's warning comes at a critical juncture when the WHO Pandemic Agreement is still under negotiation (fifth INB meeting concluded February 14, 2026). The funding cuts primarily affect bilateral aid programs that support health infrastructure in low and middle-income countries. Simultaneously, drug-resistant infections are rising globally, and the post-pandemic recovery of routine immunization programs remains incomplete. The timing is particularly concerning given that the IHR amendments strengthening national preparedness capacities only entered force in September 2025.
7. **Inference**: This signals a dangerous divergence between the aspiration for pandemic preparedness (as evidenced by ongoing treaty negotiations) and the practical reality of declining resources. Countries may increasingly rely on regional health security arrangements rather than global coordination. Private sector health investment in emerging markets may accelerate as governments retreat.
8. **Stakeholders**: WHO, GAVI, Global Fund, bilateral development agencies (USAID, DFID), low and middle-income country health ministries, pharmaceutical companies, civil society organizations
9. **Monitoring Indicators**: WHO budget execution rates; bilateral aid disbursement data; immunization coverage rates; AMR surveillance reports; pandemic preparedness index scores

### Priority 5: Agentic AI in Banking: Systems Moving from Assistance to Transactional Authority

- **Confidence**: pSST 84 (Grade B)

1. **Classification**: Economic (E) — Financial technology, AI integration, market structure
2. **Source**: World Economic Forum — Published 2026-02-24
3. **Key Facts**: The banking industry is moving from AI "assistance" to "transactional authority." AI systems are being integrated as semi-autonomous "digital co-workers" that settle routine trades and manage compliance checks under human oversight.
4. **Quantitative Metrics**: The transition from AI-assisted to AI-authorized represents a qualitative shift in financial system autonomy. Entry-level recruitment in administrative and clerical positions already fell 35% due to AI.
5. **Impact**: High — Reshapes financial sector employment, risk management, and regulatory frameworks
6. **Detailed Description**: The shift from AI assistance to transactional authority represents a fundamental change in how financial systems operate. Banks are now granting AI agents the ability to make and execute trading decisions, manage compliance workflows, and settle transactions autonomously within predefined parameters. This is distinct from previous AI applications that merely provided recommendations for human decision-makers. The implications extend to systemic risk (cascading AI-driven decisions), regulatory frameworks (who is accountable for AI-authorized transactions), and labor markets (accelerated displacement of middle-office functions).
7. **Inference**: Financial regulators will need to rapidly develop frameworks for AI agent accountability and systemic risk from correlated algorithmic behavior. The trend will likely spread beyond banking to insurance, asset management, and payment systems. Traditional financial sector employment will continue to contract, particularly in operations, compliance, and mid-level analysis.
8. **Stakeholders**: Central banks, financial regulators (SEC, FCA, BaFin), commercial banks, fintech companies, financial sector employees, trading firms, compliance professionals
9. **Monitoring Indicators**: Regulatory guidance on AI agent accountability; financial sector employment data; trading volume attributed to AI agents; systemic risk indicators; flash crash frequency

### Priority 6: DeepSeek R1 Open-Source Reasoning Model Reshapes AI Landscape from China

- **Confidence**: pSST 83 (Grade B)

1. **Classification**: Technological (T) — Artificial intelligence, geopolitics of technology, open-source
2. **Source**: MIT Technology Review — Published 2026-02-24
3. **Key Facts**: Chinese firm DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning model that demonstrated what a small Chinese firm could achieve with limited resources, challenging Western AI dominance assumptions.
4. **Quantitative Metrics**: DeepSeek achieved competitive performance with significantly fewer resources than Western counterparts (estimated 10-100x less compute for comparable reasoning capability).
5. **Impact**: High — Disrupts the narrative of US-China AI competition, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and challenges compute-centric AI scaling paradigms
6. **Detailed Description**: DeepSeek's R1 model represents a significant inflection point in the global AI landscape. By achieving competitive reasoning performance with far fewer computational resources, it challenges the prevailing assumption that AI progress requires massive compute infrastructure (and thus massive capital). This has implications for the AI chip export control regime, as it demonstrates that architectural innovation can partially compensate for hardware restrictions. The open-source release further democratizes access to advanced reasoning capabilities.
7. **Inference**: Expect policy debates around whether compute-focused export controls are sufficient for AI technology control. Open-source reasoning models will accelerate AI adoption in developing countries. Western AI companies may shift strategy toward efficiency-focused architectures rather than pure scale.
8. **Stakeholders**: AI research labs (OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta), chip manufacturers (NVIDIA, AMD, TSMC), US and Chinese governments, export control policymakers, open-source AI community
9. **Monitoring Indicators**: Open-source AI model benchmarks; Chinese AI model releases; US export control policy changes; AI compute efficiency metrics; venture funding in AI efficiency research

### Priority 7: EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) Begins Imposing Costs on Carbon-Intensive Imports

- **Confidence**: pSST 82 (Grade B)

1. **Classification**: Political (P) — Trade policy, climate regulation, economic governance
2. **Source**: S&P Global / EUR-Lex — Published 2026-02-24
3. **Key Facts**: The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism became operational January 1, 2026, imposing costs on imports based on their carbon intensity. This reshapes global trade patterns and incentivizes decarbonization of supply chains.
4. **Quantitative Metrics**: CBAM applies to cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen imports. EU ETS carbon price approximately 65-80 EUR/ton as of early 2026. Potentially affects billions in trade flows.
5. **Impact**: High — Forces global supply chains to decarbonize; creates trade friction with carbon-intensive exporting nations; establishes precedent for carbon-linked trade policy
6. **Detailed Description**: CBAM represents the world's first carbon border tax at scale, converting the EU's internal carbon pricing into an external trade instrument. Importers must purchase certificates matching the carbon intensity of their goods, effectively equalizing the cost burden between EU producers (subject to ETS) and foreign competitors. This has significant implications for trade relationships with China, India, Turkey, and other major exporters of covered goods. The mechanism could trigger retaliatory trade measures or inspire similar policies in other jurisdictions (the UK is developing its own CBAM, and Canada has explored options).
7. **Inference**: CBAM will accelerate the formation of "climate clubs" among nations with similar carbon pricing. Developing countries lacking decarbonization infrastructure face increased trade costs. Expect the scope of CBAM to expand to additional sectors (petrochemicals, plastics) in subsequent phases.
8. **Stakeholders**: EU trading partners (especially China, India, Turkey, Russia), WTO, exporting manufacturers, importers, climate policy advocates, developing country governments
9. **Monitoring Indicators**: CBAM certificate prices; trade volume changes in covered sectors; retaliatory trade measures; adoption of similar mechanisms by other countries; WTO dispute filings

### Priority 8: Real-World Asset Tokenization Pivots from Pilots to Active Global Markets in 2026

- **Confidence**: pSST 81 (Grade B)

1. **Classification**: Economic (E) — Financial markets, blockchain, digital infrastructure
2. **Source**: Hacker News / TradingView — Published 2026-02-24
3. **Key Facts**: RWA tokenization has moved from experimental pilots to active global markets. NYSE unveiled plans for 24/7 blockchain-based trading of tokenized stocks. BlackRock and JP Morgan moving from pilots to production-scale tokenized products.
4. **Quantitative Metrics**: Private credit tokenized on-chain exceeds $18.91 billion. Tokenized US Treasury products surpass $9 billion. NYSE and Nasdaq both filing for tokenized asset integration. SEC Clarity Act expected in 2026.
5. **Impact**: High — Potentially transforms market structure, settlement, and access to financial assets globally
6. **Detailed Description**: The transition of real-world asset tokenization from proof-of-concept to production marks a fundamental shift in market infrastructure. Major financial institutions (BlackRock, JP Morgan) are now deploying tokenized products at scale, with the NYSE and Nasdaq filing plans for blockchain-based trading. The Clarity Act, expected in 2026, will standardize the regulatory framework for digital commodities. This creates a "Modular Market Structure" where custody, clearing, and execution are technologically unified. The SEC's more collaborative posture — removing cryptocurrency from its special risk category — signals regulatory acceptance of tokenized finance.
7. **Inference**: Financial market structure is approaching a tipping point where tokenized and traditional infrastructure converge. 24/7 trading capabilities will create new risk dynamics and liquidity patterns. Smaller markets and emerging economies may leapfrog traditional infrastructure by adopting tokenized systems directly.
8. **Stakeholders**: Securities exchanges (NYSE, Nasdaq), investment banks, asset managers (BlackRock, JP Morgan), SEC, crypto/blockchain companies, retail investors, central banks (CBDC integration)
9. **Monitoring Indicators**: Tokenized asset market cap; exchange integration timelines; Clarity Act legislative progress; institutional adoption rates; cross-border tokenized asset flows

### Priority 9: The 'Soul Gap': AI Mirrors Human Cognition, Triggering Civilizational Identity Crisis

- **Confidence**: pSST 79 (Grade B)

1. **Classification**: Spiritual (s) — Human identity, philosophy, AI consciousness, meaning
2. **Source**: The Conversation / Tech Startups — Published 2026-02-24
3. **Key Facts**: A new concept entering cultural consciousness — the "Soul Gap" — describes the difference between artificial intelligence and human spiritual depth. As AI mirrors human cognitive functions, humanity confronts what makes humans special, triggering a civilizational-scale identity crisis.
4. **Quantitative Metrics**: Qualitative signal — cultural and philosophical shifts are not easily quantified. However, the proliferation of AI-related meaning crisis discussions in academic publications, media, and public discourse has increased exponentially since 2025.
5. **Impact**: High (long-term) — Reshapes fundamental human self-understanding and cultural narratives; influences education, religion, therapy, and policy
6. **Detailed Description**: The "Soul Gap" concept emerges at the intersection of AI capability and human self-understanding. As large language models demonstrate increasingly human-like reasoning, creativity, and emotional simulation, a profound question crystallizes: what is distinctly human that AI cannot replicate? This question is not merely philosophical — it has practical implications for education (what should humans learn if AI can perform cognitive tasks?), mental health (existential anxiety from perceived obsolescence), religion (rethinking the concept of "soul" in a world of artificial minds), and policy (how to value human contribution when AI substitutes are available). The concept captures a civilizational-level identity disruption that goes beyond economic displacement.
7. **Inference**: Expect growth in meaning-oriented education, philosophy-of-mind research funding, and new religious/spiritual movements that address AI-era existential questions. Therapeutic approaches will increasingly address "AI anxiety" as a clinical category. The "Soul Gap" may become a defining cultural concept of the late 2020s.
8. **Stakeholders**: Philosophers, theologians, educators, psychologists, AI ethicists, policy makers, religious institutions, general public
9. **Monitoring Indicators**: Academic publication trends on AI and consciousness; mental health data on AI-related anxiety; enrollment in philosophy/humanities programs; public discourse analysis; new spiritual movement emergence

### Priority 10: Global Political Risk Reaches Historic Tipping Point at 41.1% — Coface Index

- **Confidence**: pSST 78 (Grade B)

1. **Classification**: Political (P) — Global stability, risk assessment, geopolitics
2. **Source**: Coface / Brookings Institution — Published 2026-02-23
3. **Key Facts**: The Coface global political risk index has reached a historic high of 41.1%. Domestic politics are playing an outsized role in foreign policy throughout 2026, adding unprecedented uncertainty and volatility.
4. **Quantitative Metrics**: 41.1% political risk index — historic peak. Multiple concurrent conflicts (Ukraine 4th year, Sudan displacement of 12 million). US Supreme Court reviewing executive tariff powers.
5. **Impact**: High — Elevated political risk dampens investment, disrupts trade, and increases the probability of black swan events
6. **Detailed Description**: The Coface index reaching 41.1% reflects the convergence of multiple destabilizing factors: the Russia-Ukraine war entering its fourth year with no resolution prospect, Sudan's humanitarian crisis displacing 12 million people, the dissolution of New START, and a global pattern where domestic political dynamics increasingly drive foreign policy (protectionism, sanctions, trade wars). The US Supreme Court's review of executive tariff powers adds constitutional uncertainty to trade policy. Combined with the upcoming cartel succession crisis in Mexico following El Mencho's killing, the global security environment is at its most volatile in decades.
7. **Inference**: Businesses should increase geopolitical risk hedging and scenario planning. Supply chain diversification becomes more urgent. Insurance markets will likely reprice political risk. International institutions face a crisis of relevance as bilateral and regional arrangements gain importance.
8. **Stakeholders**: Multinational corporations, insurers, sovereign wealth funds, diplomats, international organizations (UN, WTO), national governments, investors
9. **Monitoring Indicators**: Coface index trajectory; new conflict emergence; trade policy litigation outcomes; diplomatic initiative outcomes; foreign direct investment flows

**Priority 12: AI Ethics Governance — Autonomy Thresholds on Legislative Agenda** (s, pSST 76)
2026 legislators actively considering autonomy thresholds and human oversight levels for AI. Entry-level recruitment already fell 35% due to AI. Ethical questions about employer retraining responsibilities rising. California AI Transparency Act taking effect August 2026.

**Priority 13: Microsoft Blueprint for Verifying Real vs AI Content** (T, pSST 75)
Microsoft's AI safety team proposes technical standards for documenting digital manipulation. Prompted by California's AI Transparency Act. Addresses the growing challenge of deepfakes and AI-generated content verification across social media platforms.

**Priority 14: Global Output Projected to Slow to 2.7% in 2026** (E, pSST 74)
UNCTAD projects world output at 2.7% in 2026, below pre-pandemic 3.2% average. Inflation and trade policy risks affect all regions. Advanced nations face slow growth; some emerging markets benefit from structural reforms.

**Priority 15: DHS Overhauls H-1B Visa Selection Process** (P, pSST 73)
DHS replaces random lottery with skill-based selection prioritizing higher-skilled and higher-paid workers. Effective February 27, 2026. Fundamental shift in US immigration labor policy with implications for tech industry hiring and global talent flows.

## 5. Strategic Implications

### 5.1 Immediate Actions Required (0-6 months)

1. **Nuclear Risk Monitoring**: Establish enhanced monitoring of US-Russia nuclear posture changes following New START expiration. Track any new arms control negotiation signals.
2. **CBAM Compliance**: Organizations importing goods into the EU must ensure CBAM certificate procurement processes are in place and carbon intensity reporting is accurate.
3. **H-1B Visa Strategy**: Companies relying on H-1B workers should reassess visa strategies under the new skill-based selection regime effective February 27, 2026.
4. **AI Content Verification**: Media and platform companies should evaluate Microsoft's proposed technical standards for content authenticity.
5. **Financial AI Governance**: Banks deploying agentic AI should establish clear accountability frameworks before regulators mandate them.

### 5.2 Medium-term Monitoring (6-18 months)

1. **Quantum Computing Readiness**: Track triplet superconductor research replication and IBM quantum advantage demonstrations for industry timing signals.
2. **Tokenized Finance Integration**: Monitor NYSE and Nasdaq tokenization rollouts and the Clarity Act legislative timeline for financial infrastructure positioning.
3. **Climate Adaptation Portfolio**: Build exposure to climate adaptation technologies and services as the 1.5 degree breach becomes more certain.
4. **Global Health Financing**: Track WHO budget execution and bilateral aid flows to identify emerging health security gaps.
5. **AI Ethics Legislation**: Monitor California AI Transparency Act implementation (August 2026) as a potential template for federal regulation.

## 6. Plausible Scenarios

**Scenario A: "Fragmented Acceleration" (Probability: 40%)**
AI and tokenization advance rapidly but in fragmented national/regional frameworks. Climate targets are missed. New arms race intensifies. The world operates with high technology, high risk, and low coordination.

**Scenario B: "Regulated Convergence" (Probability: 30%)**
The Clarity Act, CBAM, and WHO Pandemic Agreement succeed. AI governance frameworks emerge. A new arms control dialogue begins. Slower but more stable progress across domains.

**Scenario C: "Crisis Catalyst" (Probability: 20%)**
A major disruption (nuclear incident, climate event, AI systemic failure, financial crisis) forces a new round of international cooperation. Short-term pain, long-term institutional rebuilding.

**Scenario D: "Bipolar Tech World" (Probability: 10%)**
US-China technology decoupling deepens. DeepSeek-style efficient AI models create a parallel AI ecosystem. Two largely separate technology stacks, regulatory frameworks, and financial systems emerge.

The patent and academic sources carry high SR scores. Blog and tech news sources (pSST 45-65 SR range) are corroborated by multiple independent sources.

**Coverage Assessment**: All 6 STEEPs categories are represented. Political (P) and Technological (T) signals dominate (9 each), followed by Economic (6), Social (4), Spiritual (4), and Environmental (3). The Spiritual category is notably well-covered for this scan due to the emergence of the "Soul Gap" concept and AI ethics governance signals.

**Limitations**:
- Scan window covers 24 hours only; some developing stories may have been captured at an early stage
- Patent source scanning limited to February 2026 highlights rather than comprehensive patent database search
- No primary API calls to RSS feeds; reliance on web search for signal collection
