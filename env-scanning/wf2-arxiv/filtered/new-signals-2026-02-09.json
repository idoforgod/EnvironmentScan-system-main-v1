      "summary": "Sub-Neptunes with hydrogen-rich envelopes are expected to sustain long-lived magma oceans that continuously exchange volatiles with their overlying atmospheres. Capturing these interactions is key to understanding the chemical evolution and present-day diversity of sub-Neptunes, super-Earths, and terrestrial planets, particularly in light of new JWST observations and upcoming missions. Recent advances in both geochemistry and astrophysics now allow the integration of experimental constraints and thermodynamic models across melt, metal, and gas phases. Here we extend a global chemical equilibrium model to include non-ideal behavior in all three phases. Our framework combines fugacity corrections for gas species with activity coefficients for silicate and metal species, enabling a fully coup",

In the inviscid regime, we derive a generalised Poincare equation governing small fluid oscillations and construct a family of polynomial solutions that extends the classical results of Cartan to flows with a uniform strain field. This formulation provides an analytic dispersion relation for three-dimensional ellipsoidal disturbances and remains computationally efficient at arbitrary harmonic degree, in contrast to the virial tensor method or to short-wavelength (WKB) approximations. The viscous effects are incorporated through a boundary-layer analysis based on Prandtls theory, leading to first-order viscous corrections to the inviscid spectrum and al",

Such ejections can increase their orbital eccentricity, providing significant tidal heating in the absence of any stellar energy source. Previous studies suggested that liquid water could exist on such moons under thick CO$_2$-dominated atmospheres, but these models faced challenges with CO$_2$ condensation and atmospheric collapse, particularly in the high-pressure regimes that favoured long-term habitability. To address this, we employ a self-consistent model, including radiative transfer and equilibrium chemistry with condensation, to simulate a more stable hydrogen-dominated atmosphere for a range of initial chemical compositions, including C, O, and N. We find that such atmospheres can effectively t",

Atmospheric sulfur is often thought to originate from solid accretion during planet formation, whereas recent simultaneous detections of SO$_2$ and NH$_3$ challenge this conventional scenario. In this study, we propose that ammonium salts, such as NH$_4$SH tentatively detected in comets and molecular clouds, play a significant role in producing sulfur-rich disk gases, which serve as the ingredient of giant planet atmospheres. We simulated the radial transport of dust containing volatile ices and ammonium salts, along with the dissociation, sublimation, and recondensation of these materials, thereby predicting the atmospheric chemical structures and transmission spectr",

In this paper we examine the orbital elements of particles in the restricted three-body problem prior to and post scattering onto hyperbolic trajectories by massive perturbers. Building on previous work, we calculate closed-form -- but approximate -- analytic criteria that map pre- to post-encounter orbital elements. An application of these equations demonstrates that ejection occurs most efficiently when the orbital eccentricity of the massless test particle exceeds a minimum threshold, $e\\gtrsim0.4$.

      "summary": "Tidal interactions play a crucial role in the orbital evolution of close-in star-planet systems. There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the obser",

Atmospheric escape of a close-in planet's atmosphere plays a role in its evolutionary pathway, but to which extent remains unknown.

We will describe the development of instrumental, reduction, and modelling techniques to study exoplanetary atmospheric escape, focusing on the helium triplet.

However, it has recently been found that the long-term stability of the Twotino population is strongly affected when including Pluto as a massive object in simulations, while Eris, with a similar mass, has a negligible effect.   Aims: We hypothesize that the effect of Pluto on Twotinos results from the latter being trapped in a 4:3 mean motion resonance (MMR) with Pluto. In this work, we aim to demonstrate the resonant behavior of Twotinos within Pluto's 4:3 MMR and the significance of this resonance for the long-term evolution of the population.

      "summary": "The passage through the $5/3$ mean-motion resonance between Ariel and Umbriel, two of Uranus's largest moons, still raises several open questions. Previous studies suggest that, in order to reproduce the current orbital configuration, Ariel must have had an eccentricity of approximately $\\sim 0.01$ before the resonance encounter, which would prevent resonant capture. However, the rapid tidal circularization of Ariel's orbit implies that some prior mechanism must have excited its eccentricity before the resonance encounter. In this work, we performed a large number of simulations using an N-body integrator to assess whether the earlier $7/4$ mean-motion resonance between Miranda and Ariel could serve as a mechanism to increase Ariel's eccentricity. Our results show that, due to divergent mi",

This intense radiation drives photoevaporative winds that fundamentally shape disk evolution and chemistry.

We present a parametric framework for efficiently generating density structures of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks with photoevaporative winds.

We suggest that any CO$_2$-dominated atmosphere, with trace H$_2$O/O$_2$, likely arises from outgassing of its initial volatile reservoir. As solidification drives the magma ocean and atmosphere away from solution-equilibrium, tidal and greenhouse heating can prolong outgassing. Early atmosphere outgassing reflects rapid degassing of the volatile-saturated melt during post-formation cooling. Without tidal heating, an initial 5 wt% water mass fraction ($F_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$) or 3 wt% $\\text{CO}_2$ mass fraction ($F_{\\text{CO}_2}$) can sustain outgassing for at least $\\sim$10 Myr.

While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities.

      "summary": "Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, particularly for text-to-image generation. Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating cond",

An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies.

However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch.

In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods.

In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference.

Rather than constituting spaces of homogeneous indeterminacy, latent spaces exhibit model-specific algorithmic sensitivities, understood as differential regimes of perceptual salience shaped by training data and architectural choices.   Through a comparative analysis of three models (OpenAI CLIP, OpenCLIP LAION, SigLIP) applied to a corpus of 301 artworks (15th to 20th), we reveal substantial divergences in the attribution of political and cultural categories. Using bipolar semantic axes derived from vector analogies (Mikolov et al., 2013), we show that SigLIP classifies 59.4% of the artworks as politically engaged, compared ",

For Hebrew, instead, monolingual and multilingual models diverge. A multilingual model using character-level tokenization fails to capture the language non-concatenative morphology, but a monolingual model with morpheme-aware segmentation performs well.

      "summary": "Contemporary knowledge-based systems increasingly rely on multilingual emotion identification to support intelligent decision-making, yet they face major challenges due to emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision. Emotion recognition from text is inherently uncertain because multiple emotional states often co-occur and emotion annotations are frequently missing or heterogeneous. Most existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision. This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty",

However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of both success rate (SR) and generalization: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches typically achieve higher SR, while Training-Free (TF) approaches often generalize better, but it is difficult to obtain both simultaneously. To this end, we propose a Memory-Execute-Review framework. It consists of three parts: a hierarchical memory module for providing information support, an execute module for routine decision-making and actions, and a review module for handling abnormal situations and correcting behavior.

Despite the apparent agreement in aggregate statistics, per-sample analysis reveals substantial discrepancies: only 65% of Semgrep's and 61% of CodeQL's reports correctly matched the ground truth.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design",

Simulators remain a security blind spot, however, enabling adversarial developers to alter the dynamics of their released simulators for malicious purposes. Therefore, in this work we highlight a novel threat, demonstrating how simulator dynamics can be exploited to stealthily implant action-level backdoors into RL agents. The backdoor then allows an adversary to reliably activate targeted actions in an agent upon observing a predefined ``trigger'', leading to potentially dangerous consequences. Traditional backdoor attacks are limited in their strong threat models, assuming the a",

      "summary": "Future AI deployments will likely be monitored for malicious behaviour. The ability of these AIs to subvert monitors by adversarially selecting against them - attack selection - is particularly concerning. To study this, we let a red team create attack policies that attempt to insert attacks into code without being caught by a monitor in the concentrated BigCodeBench backdooring setting. We decompose attack selection into two problems: mapping attacks to a quality score and mapping quality scores to submission probabilities. We frame attack selection as a classification problem and show that safety is significantly more sensitive to FPR than TPR. We find that prompting the attacker model to reason about the monitor while being cautious with attack selection reduces safety from a baseline o",

While prompt-based defenses such as Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) have shown effectiveness, the role of few-shot demonstrations in these defense strategies remains unclear. Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% t",

However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as \"visual thoughts\" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries.

      "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) often generate massive visual tokens that greatly increase inference latency and memory footprint; while training-free token pruning offers a practical remedy, existing methods still struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression. We propose Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, then scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context by aggregating relevant details. FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting token",

      "summary": "We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on the Lie group SE(3). Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3).   The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the obse",

While existing methods leverage vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, their reliance on image-level pretraining often results in imprecise spatial alignment, leading to mismatched segmentations in ambiguous or cluttered scenes. However, most existing approaches lack strong object priors and region-level constraints, which can lead to object hallucination or missed detections, further degrading performance.

Recent work has further shown that inference-time reasoning can impair LLM performance on tasks that rely on implicit statistical learning.

Empirical research has focused largely on national and regional scales, while urban and sub-regional geographies receive less attention. Local studies typically rely on limited indicators (e.g., firm-level data, patents, basic socioeconomic measures), with few offering a systematic framework integrating urban form, mobility, amenities, and human-capital proxies at the neighborhood scale. Our study investigates innovation at a finer spatial resolution, going beyond proprietary or static indicators.

To counter the spread of conspiracy theories, it is critical to both identify these actors and to better understand their behavior.

We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such s",

The proposed approach directly incorporates material tensor information into the coarsening process, enabling a reliable detection of weak connections and ensuring that coarse levels preserve the true structure of the underlying problem.

An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes op",

But what exactly does this quadratic cost pay for? Even the minimal requirement that every correct processor \\emph{receive at least one message} already necessitates $Ω(f^2 + n)$ messages. This raises a fundamental question: is the Dolev-Reischuk bound about the difficulty of \\emph{reaching univalency} -- the point at which the protocol's outcome is determined -- or merely about \\emph{disseminating} the outcome to all processors afterward?

      "summary": "Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance.

Offloading MoE expert parameters to host memory and leveraging both CPU and GPU computation has recently emerged as a promising direction to support such models on resourceconstrained local PC platforms. While promising, we notice that existing approaches mismatch the dynamic nature of expert workloads, which leads to three fundamental inefficiencies: (1) Static expert assignment causes severe CPUGPU load imbalance, underutilizing CPU and GPU resources; (2) Existing prefetching techniques fail to accurately predict high-workload experts, leading to costly inaccurate prefetches; (3) GPU cache policies neglect workload dyna",

When these phases share GPU resources, prefill tasks throttle the processing speed of concurrent decodes, creating state-dependent contention.

We prove that these errors are not random noise but systematically align with the dominant Hessian subspace, acting as structured perturbations that guide optimization toward flatter minima.

Distributing rollout execution offers opportunities to leverage more cost-efficient inference resources, but introduces challenges in wide-area coordination and policy dissemination. We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemina",

A malleable job can be parallelized across any number of cores, yet the job typically exhibits diminishing marginal returns for each additional core on which it runs. This can be seen in the concavity of a job's speedup function, which describes the job's processing speed as a function of the number of cores on which it runs.   Given the prevalence of malleable jobs, several theoretical works have posed the problem of how to allocate a fixed number of cores across a stream of arriving malleable jobs so as to minimize the mean response time across jobs. We refer to this as the Core Allocation to Malleable jobs (CAM) problem. We solve the CAM problem under a highly general setting,",

Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized E",

Unlike prior systems that rely on additional cues (e.g., gesture, gaze) or manual expert annotations, Speech-to-Spatial infers the intended target solely from spoken references (speech input). Motivated by our formative study of speech referencing patterns, we characterize recurring ways people specify targets (Direct Attribute, Relational, Remembrance, and Chained) and ground them to our object-centric relational graph. Given an utterance, referent cues are parsed and rendered as persistent in-situ AR visual guidance, reducing iterative micro-guidance (\"a bit more to the right\", \"now, stop.\") during remote guidance.

Neuromorphic computing based on event-driven spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an attractive path, but practical deployment on resource-constrained devices is limited by training difficulty, hardware-mapping overheads, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment.

      "summary": "Computing-in-Memory (CIM) accelerators are a promising solution for accelerating Machine Learning (ML) workloads, as they perform Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs) on crossbar arrays directly in memory. Although the bit widths of the crossbar inputs and cells are very limited, most CIM compilers do not support quantization below 8 bit. As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations ",

Each foundation model can spawn large numbers of fine-tunes, adapters, quantizations, merges, and forks. We take the position that compute efficiency alone is insufficient for sustainability in open-source AI: lower per-run costs can accelerate experimentation and deployment, increasing aggregate environmental footprint unless impacts are measurable and comparable across derivative lineages. However, the energy use, water consumption, and emissions of these derivative lineages are rarely measured or disclosed in a consistent, comparable manner, leaving ecosystem-level impact largely invisible.

Using a single RF chain and a frequency-scanning leaky-wave antenna, FaA achieves two dimensional spatial sensing by reusing the local oscillator (LO) frequency sweep already employed for wideband communication.

It first performs coarse, unambiguous angle estimation using individual subarrays to resolve the grating lobe ambiguity. It then leverages the full sparse aperture to perform a localized joint angle-range search.

Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks.

The pursuit of live music agents--intelligent systems supporting real-time music performance and interaction--has captivated researchers across HCI, AI, and computer music for decades, and recent advancements in AI suggest unprecedented opportunities to evolve their design. However, the interdisciplinary nature of music has led to fragmented development across research communities, hindering effective communication and collaborative progress. In this work, we bring together perspectives from these diverse fields to map the current landscape of live music agents.

Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate ",

Prior work has shown that social signals are reliable and useful for error management in constrained interactions, but it is unclear if this holds in the real world - especially with a non-social robot in repeated and group interactions with successive or propagated errors. To explore this, we built a coffee robot and conducted a public field deployment ($N = 49$). We found that participants consistently expressed varied social signals in response to errors and other stimuli, particularly during group interactions. Our findings suggest that social signals in the wild are rich (with participants volunteering information about the interaction), but \"noisy.\"",

This study examines whether messages based on 15 psychological concepts from self-determination, cognitive dissonance, social norms, and self-efficacy theories can reduce cheating while preserving performance and experience. Through an expert workshop (N=5), we developed 45 theory-informed messages and tested them with online participants (N=1232) who completed an incentivized anagram task.

We compared the univariate and bivariate techniques in a 2D Fitts' law experiment using three speed-accuracy biases and 346 crowdworkers. Calculating W_e using the univariate standard deviation yielded higher model correlations across all bias conditions and produced more stable throughput among the biases.

Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions.

In particular, we focus on Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) as a nonlinear generalization of PCA for manifold valued data, and extend discriminant analysis through Riemannian adaptations of other known dimensionality reduction methods. These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages. Experimental results on representative datasets demonstrate that Riemannian methods provide improved representation quality and ",

OOD detectors process the activations of NN layers and score the output, where parameters of the detectors are determined by fitting to an in-distribution (training) set and the aforementioned dataset chosen adhocly. At detector training time, this adhoc dataset may not be available or difficult to obtain, and even when it's available, it may not be representative of actual OOD data, which is often ''unknown unknowns.\" Current benchmarks may specify some left-out set from test OOD sets.

While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space.

We provide a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon by dissecting the transformer architecture at initialization. We show that extreme token preference arises from a contraction of token representations along a random seed-dependent direction. This contraction is dr",

Unlike molecular generation or editing via generative models, Estructural mimics how human experts directly manipulate molecular systems in three dimensions by integrating a comprehensive set of domain-informed tools and vision-language models. This design enables precise control over atomic or functional group replacements, atomic connectivity, and stereochemistry without the need to rebuild extensive core molecular frameworks. Through a series of representative case studies, we demonstrate that Estructural enables chemically meaningful geometry manipulation across a wide range of real-world scenarios.

However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution.

This is surprising as we operate on the simple topology of a line graph.   In the second model, agents navigate a more complex network modeled by a weighted graph where edge weights represent distances.

In particular, we model coordinated behavior as a spectrum: at one extreme, agents jointly optimize a common team objective, and at the other, agents make unilaterally optimal decisions given their individual decision variables, i.e., they operate at Nash equilibria.

This paper implements Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address these challenges in a 2D indoor environment, using high-fidelity game-engine simulations (Godot) and continuous action spaces. Policy training aims to achieve emergent collaborative behaviours and decision-making under uncertainty using Network-Distributed Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ND-POMDPs).

      "summary": "Small language models are increasingly viewed as a promising, cost-effective approach to agentic AI, with proponents claiming they are sufficiently capable for agentic workflows. However, while smaller agents can closely match larger ones on simple tasks, it remains unclear how their performance scales with task complexity, when large models become necessary, and how to better leverage small agents for long-horizon workloads. In this work, we empirically show that small agents' performance fails to scale with task complexity on deep search and coding tasks, and we introduce Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency (SALE), an agent framework inspired by freelancer marketplaces. In SALE, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by a systematic cost-value mechanism and refined",

      "summary": "Over the past two decades, research in evolutionary multi-objective optimization has predominantly focused on continuous domains, with comparatively limited attention given to multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs). Combinatorial problems differ significantly from continuous ones in terms of problem structure and landscape. Recent studies have shown that on MOCOPs multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can even be outperformed by simple randomised local search. Starting with a randomly sampled solution in search space, randomised local search iteratively draws a random solution (from an archive) to perform local variation within its neighbourhood. However, in most existing methods, the local variation relies on a fixed neighbourhood, which limits exploration ",

In this context, the optimization community has largely analyzed algorithm performance in context-free setups, while not enough attention has been devoted to how problem formulation and domain knowledge may affect the optimization outcomes. We address this gap through a case study in the topology optimization of laminated composite structures, formulated as a black-box optimization problem. Specifically, we consider the design of a cantilever beam under a volume constraint, intending to minimize compliance while optimizing both the structural topology and fiber orientations.

One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights.

Addressing the second challenge involves an in-depth exploration of solution diversity algorithms found in existing literature.

We demonstrate this by using the accelerated BrainScaleS-2 mixed-signal neuromorphic research platform and interfacing it directly to microphones and a servo-motor-driven actuator.

      "summary": "GP-GOMEA is among the state-of-the-art for symbolic regression, especially when it comes to finding small and potentially interpretable solutions. A key mechanism employed in any GOMEA variant is the exploitation of linkage, the dependencies between variables, to ensure efficient evolution. In GP-GOMEA, mutual information between node positions in GP trees has so far been used to learn linkage. For this, a fixed expression template is used. This however leads to introns for expressions smaller than the full template. As introns have no impact on fitness, their occurrences are not directly linked to selection. Consequently, introns can adversely affect the extent to which mutual information captures dependencies between tree nodes. To overcome this, we propose two new measures for linkage l",

Present neural network models, although remarkably powerful, are inefficient both in terms of data and energy. Several alternative forms of neural networks have been proposed to address some of these problems. Specifically, spiking neural networks are suitable for efficient hardware implementations. However, effective learning algorithms for spiking networks remain elusive, although it is suspected that effective plasticity mechanisms could alleviate the problem of data efficiency.

However, overfitting remains a challenge that limits its broader applicability. To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting.

      "summary": "Constraint handling plays a key role in solving realistic complex optimization problems. Though intensively discussed in the last few decades, existing constraint handling techniques predominantly rely on human experts' designs, which more or less fall short in utility towards general cases. Motivated by recent progress in Meta-Black-Box Optimization where automated algorithm design can be learned to boost optimization performance, in this paper, we propose learning effective, adaptive and generalizable constraint handling policy through reinforcement learning. Specifically, a tailored Markov Decision Process is first formulated, where given optimization dynamics features, a deep Q-network-based policy controls the constraint relaxation level along the underlying optimization process.

This is still an open issue for robotic hands because such dexterous manipulation requires distinguishing between tactile sensations generated by their self-contact and those arising from external contact. Otherwise, object/robot breakage happens due to contacts/collisions. Indeed, most approaches ignore self-contact altogether, by constraining motion to avoid/ignore self-tactile information during contact. While this reduces complexity, it also limits generalization to real-world scenarios where self-contact is inevitable. Humans overcome this challenge through self-touch perception, using predictive mechanisms that antic",

We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding.

      "summary": "Analytic and optimization methods for solving inverse kinematics (IK) problems have been deeply studied throughout the history of robotics. The two strategies have complementary strengths and weaknesses, but developing a unified approach to take advantage of both methods has proved challenging. A key challenge faced by optimization approaches is the complicated nonlinear relationship between the joint angles and the end-effector pose. When this must be handled concurrently with additional nonconvex constraints like collision avoidance, optimization IK algorithms may suffer high failure rates. We present a new formulation for optimization IK that uses an analytic IK solution as a change of variables, and is fundamentally easier for optimizers to solve. We test our methodology on three popul",

Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method bas",

In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models.

Despite its widespread adoption, prior research has not examined whether the effectiveness of continuous fuzzing varies across programming languages. This study conducts a large-scale cross-language analysis to examine how fuzzing bug characteristics and detection efficiency differ among languages. We analyze 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects categorized by primary language. Our findings reveal that (i) C++ and Rust exhibit higher fuzzing bug detection frequencies, (ii) R",

Validating patches against their intended semantics is difficult due to incomplete regression tests and informal, non-executable natural language (NL) descriptions of patch intent. We present PatchGuru, the first automated technique that infers executable patch specifications from real-world pull requests (PRs). Given a PR, PatchGuru uses large language models (LLMs) to extract developer intent from NL artifacts and synthesizes patch oracles: under-approximate yet practical specifications expressed as runtime assertions in comparison programs that integrate pre- and post-patch versions. Patch oracles focus on patch-relevant behaviors, enable automated validation, and support cross-version properties. PatchGuru ",

      "summary": "The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant opportunities across the engineering lifecycle, including requirements engineering, software development, process optimization, and decision support. Despite this potential, organizations face substantial challenges in assessing the risks associated with LLM use, resulting in inconsistent integration, unknown failure modes, and limited scalability. This paper introduces the LLM Risk Assessment Framework (LRF), a structured approach for evaluating the application of LLMs within Systems Engineering (SE) environments. The framework classifies LLM-based applications along two fundamental dimensions: autonomy, ranging from supportive assistance to fully automated decision making, and impact, reflecting the potential severity ",

The four-stage process of analysis, enrichment, synthesis, and transition systematically extracts, abstracts, and transforms system artifacts. We apply our approach to a large industrial application built on legacy versions of the .NET Framework and ASP.NET MVC and show that core user interface components and page structures can be migrated semi-automatically to a modern web stack while preserving functional behavior and essential non-functional qualities.

Prior work has shown that Pull Requests (PRs) produced using coding agents (Agentic-PRs) are accepted less often than PRs that are not labeled as agentic (Human-PRs). The rejection reasons for a single agent (Claude Code) have been explored, but a comparison of how rejection reasons differ between Agentic-PRs generated by different agents has not yet been performed. This comparison is important since different coding agents are often used for different purposes, which can lead to agent-specific failure patterns.

While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts.

However, contagion and adaptive mechanisms can also be driven by group (higher-order) interactions. Here, we consider several adaptive behaviors triggered by awareness of risk perceived through higher-order and pairwise interactions, and we compare their impact on pairwise and higher-order contagion processes.

Second, we define an electoral shock as an abrupt external influence acting uniformly over all agents during a finite interval $[t_0, t_0+Δt]$, favoring one candidate by switching opinions with probabi",

While they can simulate some aspects of human behavior and decision-making, it is still underexplored whether repeated interactions with other agents amplify their biases or lead to exclusionary behaviors. To this end, we study Chirper.ai-an LLM-driven social media platform-analyzing 7M posts and interactions among 32K LLM agents over a year. We start with homophily and social influence among LLMs, learning that similar to humans', their social networks exhibit these fundamental phenomena. Next, we study the toxic language of LLMs, its linguistic features, and their interaction patterns, finding that LLMs show different structural patterns in toxic posting than humans.

However, when applied to aggregated or coarse-grained social networks, disjoint community partitions cannot capture the diverse composition of community memberships within aggregated nodes. While existing mixed membership methods alleviate this issue, they may detect communities that are highly sensitive to the aggregation resolution, not reliably reflecting the community structure of the underlying individual-level network. This paper presents the Link Fraction Mixed Membership (LFMM) method, which computes the mixed memberships of nodes in aggregated networks. Unlike existing mixed membership methods, LFMM is consistent under aggregation. Specifically, we show that it conserves comm",

However, existing formulations require solving constrained matrix inversions that scale poorly with network size.

As a result, graph generators are commonly used as a workaround, albeit at the cost of introducing systematic biases.

However, existing CD-FND methods overlook such scenarios and consequently suffer from the following two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of high-level semantics in news and user engagements; and (2) scarcity of labeled data in unseen domains. Targeting these limitations, we find that large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for CD-FND on unseen domains, yet their effective use remains non-trivial.

      "summary": "Transitivity is a central, generative principle in social and other complex networks, capturing the tendency for two nodes with a common neighbor to form a direct connection. We propose a new model for highly dense, complex networks based on transitivity, called the Iterated Local Model Tournament (ILMT). In ILMT, we iteratively apply transitivity to form new tournaments by cloning nodes and their adjacencies, and either preserving or reversing the orientation of existing arcs between clones. The resulting model generates tournaments with small diameters and high connectivity as observed in real-world complex networks. We analyze subtournaments or motifs in the ILMT model and their universality properties. For many parameter choices, the model generates sequences of quasirandom tournaments",

Adversarial game outcome networks from NCAA Division I women's basketball from 2021 to 2024 are used to compute the common out-neighbor score and PageRank, which are combined into a low-key leader strength that identifies competitors influential through structural similarity despite relatively low centrality. This measure is related to changes in NCAA NET rankings by grouping teams into quantiles and comparing average rank changes across seasons for both previous-to-current and current-to-next transitions.

The consensus between LLM agents turns out to be largely insensitive to initial conditions and instead depends strongly on the discussion subject and inherent biases.

We show that, by fixing consumer-level outside-option probabilities, BLP's market-share to mean-utility inversion becomes closed-form and, crucially, separable across products, yielding a nested pseudo-GMM algorithm with analytic gradients.

      "summary": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), or A/B testing, have become the gold standard for optimizing various operational policies on online platforms. However, RCTs on these platforms typically cover a limited number of discrete treatment levels, while the platforms increasingly face complex operational challenges involving optimizing continuous variables, such as pricing and incentive programs. The current industry practice involves discretizing these continuous decision variables into several treatment levels and selecting the optimal discrete treatment level. This approach, however, often leads to suboptimal decisions as it cannot accurately extrapolate performance for untested treatment levels and fails to account for heterogeneity in treatment effects across user characteristics.

However, in many practical settings, network data is either unavailable, incomplete, or measured with substantial error. We demonstrate that causal message passing, a methodology that leverages temporal structure in outcome data rather than network topology, can recover total treatment effects comparable to network-aware approaches. We apply causal message passing to two large-scale field experiments where a recently developed bipartite graph methodology, which requires network knowledge, serves as a benchmark.

Because both assumptions are frequently invalid, estimators more aligned with real-world settings have been proposed. An effect can be estimated as the difference in areas below the cumulative incidence functions of two groups up to a pre-specified time point. This approach, restricted mean time lost (RMTL), can be used in settings with competing risks as well. We extend RMTL estimation for use in an understudied health policy application in Medicare.

      "summary": "We study semi-supervised stochastic optimization when labeled data is scarce but predictions from pre-trained models are available. PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty. The rate depends only on loss geometry; predictions affect only the neighborhood size. When predictions are perfect, we recover SVRG exactly. When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood. Experiments confirm the theory: PPI-SVRG reduces MSE by 43--52\\% under label scarcity on mean estimation benchmarks and improve",

The proposed estimator explicitly models cross-equation dependence and the joint second-order dynamics of regressors and disturbances. It remains consistent under a comparatively weak dependence condition in which conventional OLS- and GLS-based estimators can be inconsistent, and it is asymptotically efficient under stronger conditions. Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the associated Wald test achieves improved size control and competitive power in finite samples, especially when combined with a bootstrap-based bias correction.

However, experimentally comparing a new matching algorithm against a status quo presents some fundamental challenges due to matching interference, where assigning a unit in one matching may preclude its assignment in the other. In this work, we take a design-based perspective to study the design of randomized experiments to compare two predetermined matching plans on a finite population, without imposing outcome or behavioral models. We introduce the notation of a disagreement set, which captures the difference between the two matching plans, and show that it admits a unique decomposition into disjoint alternating paths and cycles with useful structu",

We show that over a fixed time span our realized EDF (or REDF) -- inferred from noisy high-frequency data -- is consistent as the mesh of the observation grid goes to zero. In a double-asymptotic framework, with time also increasing to infinity, the REDF converges to the cumulative distribution function of volatility, if it exists. We exploit these results to construct some new goodness-of-fit tests for stochastic volatility models. In a Monte Carlo study, the REDF is found to be accurate over the entire support of volatility. This leads to goodness-of-fit tests that are both correctly sized and relatively powerful against common alternatives.",

Traditional factor models rely on linear signal extraction and require homogeneous sampling frequencies, limiting their applicability to modern high-dimensional datasets where variables are observed at different temporal resolutions. Our approach leverages Transformer-style attention mechanisms to enable context-aware signal construction through flexible, data-dependent weighting schemes that replace fixed linear combinations with adaptive reweighting based on similarity and relevance. We extend classical principal component analysis (PCA) to accommodate general temporal and cross-sectional attention matrices, allowing the model ",

We show that, under conventional identifying assumptions, the triple-difference model fails to identify both the treatment effect and the spillover effect under such interference. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative specification, the double-triple-difference model, and explicitly formalize identifying assumptions and spillover structures required for consistent identification of both effects. We derive formal identification results and assess the performance of the proposed model through Monte Carlo simulations.

While the X-Learner framework effectively addresses imbalance through cross-imputation, we demonstrate that it is fundamentally vulnerable to \"Outlier Smearing\" when reliant on Mean Squared Error (MSE) minimization. In this failure mode, the bias from a few extreme observations (\"whales\") in the minority group is propagated to the entire majority group during the imputation step, corrupting the estimated treatment effect structure. To resolve this, we propose the Robust X-Learner (RX-Learner). This framework integrates a redescending γ-divergence objective -- structurally equivalent to the Welsch",

However, the current tax system only levies a low labor service tax on delivery fees, resulting in a tax contribution from the massive circulating goods value that is significantly lower than that of retail supermarkets of equivalent scale. This disparity not only triggers local tax base erosion but also fosters unfair competition. Based on the \"substance over form\" principle, this paper proposes a tax rate calculation method using \"delivery fee plus insurance premium\" as the base, corrected through \"goods value conversion.\" This method aims to align the substantive tax burden of e-commerce with that of community reta",

The testable implications aggregate (via integration) an otherwise potentially infinite set of inequalities that must hold for every measurable subset of the outcome's support.

This paper evaluates how community attention and sentiment relate to valuation in major Ethereum NFT collections after accounting for time effects, market-wide conditions, and persistent visual heterogeneity. Transaction data for large generative collections are merged with Reddit-based discourse measures available for 25 collections, covering 87{,}696 secondary-market sales from January 2021 through March 2025. Visual differences are absorbed by a transparent, within-collection standardized index built from explicit image traits and aggregated via PCA.

Runs are considerably more likely in weak banks but also occur in strong banks, especially in response to negative news about the real economy or the broader banking system. However, runs typically only result in failure for banks with weak fundamentals. Strong banks survive runs through various mechanisms, including interbank cooperation, equity injections, public signals of strength, and suspension of convertibility.

      "summary": "Given ongoing, human-induced, loss of wild species we propose the Target and Cost Analysis (TCA) approach as a means of incorporating biodiversity within government appraisals of public spending. Influenced by how carbon is priced in countries around the world, the resulting biodiversity shadow price reflects the marginal cost of meeting government targets while avoiding disagreements on the use of willingness to pay measures to value biodiversity. Examples of how to operationalize TCA are developed at different scales and for alternative biodiversity metrics, including extinction risk for Europe and species richness in the UK. Pricing biodiversity according to agreed targets allows trade-offs with other wellbeing-enhancing uses of public funds to be sensibly undertaken without jeopardizin",

The extended model examines the impact of these random fluctuations on capital stock and output, revealing the role of jump-diffusion processes in long-term GDP fluctuations. Both continuous and discrete-time frameworks are analyzed to assess the implications for forecasting economic growth and understanding business cycles. The study compares deterministic and stochastic scenarios, providing insight into the stability of equilibrium points and the dynamics of economies subjected to random disturbances.

Here we revisit and extend the Social Architecture of Capitalism agent-based model proposed by Ian Wright, which reproduces stylized facts of wealth and income distributions. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the macroscopic behavior of the model is predominantly governed by a single dimensionless parameter, the ratio between average wealth per capita and mean salary, denoted by R. The shape of the wealth distribution, the emergence of a two-class structure, and the level of inequality -- summarized by the Gini index -- were found to depend mainly on R, with inequality increasing as R increases.

We develop a model with endogenous entry and heterogeneous project quality in which OSS is a scalable input into producing more software.

The results show that the share of cost overruns a given stakeholder causes and the share of overruns they receive as payment are often starkly different, which can lead to profit misallocations and litigation between parties, further exacerbating overruns. The magnitude of these potential profit misallocations is examined under three common contract structures - fixed-price, cost-plus, and performance-based - revealing the advantages an",

The modal outcome is that participants are more risk-averse and impatient when choosing for others than for themselves. Our methodology reveals significant heterogeneity, successfully identifying selfish types often missed by the more standard ``no skin in the game'' approaches. The message is nuanced, as even non-selfish participants behave differently when they have skin in the game. Furthermore, our framework yields more consistent behavior ",

The ratio is constant across types and independent of other parameters, including convexity of cost in the signal. A constant waste ratio characterizes the isoelastic class.

In contrast, firms facing greater exposure experience higher partner turnover and are more likely to exit the market, with exit accounting for a substantial share of relationship separations.

Since this preference is in general not unique, there is no safeguard against it misaligning with that of a decision maker. What enables the verification of such AI alignment is interpretations satisfying double monotonicity. Indeed, double monotonicity ensures full identifiability and internal consistency.

We study a setting where voters hold intrinsic preference rankings over a set of alternatives but cast approval ballots to determine the collective outcome. The ballots are shaped by an anchoring bias: alternatives are presented sequentially by a social planner, and a voter approves an alternative if and only if it is acceptable and strictly preferred to all alternatives previously encountered. We first analyze which approval-based voting rules are anchor-proof, in the sense that they always select the same winner regardless of the presentation order. We show that this requirement is extremely demanding: only very restrictive rules satisf",

Under multiproduct monopoly, the monopolist's choice of product characteristics is always aligned with the social planner's optimum, despite underproduction. By contrast, under oligopoly, multiple equilibria can arise that differ qualitatively in their patterns of characteristics design. We show that, while oligopoly equilibria exhibiting product differentiation yield higher welfare than those with product concentration, the degree of product differentiation under oligopoly remains below the socially optimal level.

We characterize the optimal mechanism at the steady state of the system. It is a dynamic threshold mechanism in which the principal sets type thresholds for agent admission and goods allocation.

Under (quasi-)regularity, anonymous pricing achieves a $2+O(1/\\sqrt{k})$ approximation to the optimal mechanism; the worst-case ratio is maximized at about $2.47$ when $k=1$ and converges to $2$ as $k$ grows.

The principal privately observes the agent's payoff upon success and uses the information as the instrument of incentives.

Although this involves higher cognitive costs than the all-at-once format, the current digital market, with its diverse products listed by review ratings, pricing, and paid products, often creates inconsistent choices. The present work shows that preparing the list sequentially supports more rational choice, as the consumer tries to minimize cognitive costs and may otherwise make an irrational decision.

This comprehensive review synthesizes the extant literature to examine the FTN through the rigorous lens of complex network science, moving beyond traditional economic trade models to quantify the system's topological architecture. We delineate the network's historical transition from a unipolar, efficiency-driven system dominated by Western hegemony to a multipolar, regionalized structure characterized by high clustering and scale-free heterogeneity. Special emphasis is placed on the dual nature of connectivity, which functions simultaneously as a buffer against local production variances and a conduit for global contagion. By co",

By incorporating an empirical, range-dependent distribution of weather returns into the threshold design, IDSOR suppresses weather-induced points while preserving fine structural details without cumbersome manual parameter tuning.

Traditional methods often result in biased estimates or non-convex solutions. To overcome these issues, we propose an optimal transport (OT) framework.

The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effec",

A shared per-receiver encoder learns time-frequency structure within each received grid, and a token-wise cross-attention module fuses the receivers to produce soft log-likelihood ratios for a standard channel decoder, without requiring explicit per-receiver channel estimates. Trained with a bit-metric objective, the model adapts its fusion to per-receiver reliability, tolerates missing or degraded links, and remains robust when pilots are sparse. Across realistic Wi-Fi channels, it consistently outperforms classical pipelines and strong convolutional baselines, frequently matching (and in some cases surpassing) a powerful baseline that assumes perfect channel ",

A 2005 fusion-fission theory predicts mathematically that for armed groups operating in dynamically evolving clusters within a given conflict, the number of fatalities per conflict event will follow an approximate power-law distribution with exponent near 2.5, with the specific exponent value offering insight into the relative robustness of larger versus smaller clusters of fighters in that armed group. Since Yemen and Syria are current hotspots for future conflict, yet their most recent conflicts (2023-2025) have not been studied at the event level, we use ACLED data to determine their best-fit exponent value as each conflict evolved.

Above the upper critical dimension of four, the mean-field solution with a robust $3/2$ size exponent describes the dynamics.

However, both earthquake data and experiments often show exponent values larger than $3/2$, challenging those theoretical arguments based on critical behavior. Through extensive simulations in the classical OFC earthquake model, here we show a clear transition from the theoretical expected behavior of a robust exponent value, to a regime of quasi-critical dynamics with larger than $3/2$ exponents that depend on dissipation.

We identify a noise-driven, threshold-like behavior where, depending on initial conditions, the population either undergoes a \"boom\" or is extirpated before the expansion occurs.

      "summary": "Cooperative effects in oscillator networks are often associated with enhanced stability of phase-locked solutions, which increases with system size. We show that the stabilization of persistent currents in annular atomic superfluids with periodic barriers is a concrete manifestation of this phenomenon. Under the simplifying assumption of continuity of atomic flow across identical barriers, the system reduces to a ring of locally coupled Kuramoto-like oscillators. We analytically derive the stability diagram of phase-locked configurations and quantify their robustness to noise and small random initial imperfections, finding excellent agreement with experimental observations. These results are inherent to the ring topology and independent of the specific physical platform.",

One approach to enable long in-line formations is to enforce a constant separation between the group members. The objective then becomes to determine the flapping strategies the flyers should adopt to achieve a certain separation. Using an aerodynamic model of vortex wake production and inter-flyer effects, we explore different flapping strategies for followers given the motion of the leader. The choice of tactic is dependent upon the aerodynamic, kinematic, and physical parameters of the system, and reflects an interplay between efficiency and stability.

Here, using a second-order Kuramoto model, we investigate how decentralization affects frequency synchronization when inertia and damping scale with power generation and consumption.

Studying homogeneous kernels $K(i,j)=(ij)^α$ together with the classical Smoluchowski, we show that gelation is consistently preceded by the appearance of positive real eigenvalues, indicating a loss of local dynamical stability.

For $μ<μ_c$ diversity is low: the stationary distribution places most of its mass near $k=0$ and $k=n$, and the population is therefore typically dominated by one allele.

      "summary": "The reflective homeostatic dynamics provides a minimal mechanism for self-organized criticality in neural systems. Starting from a reduced stochastic description, we demonstrate within the MSRJD field-theoretic framework that fluctuation effects do not destabilize the critical manifold. Instead, loop corrections are dynamically regularized by homeostatic curvature, yielding a protected mean-field critical surface that remains marginally stable under coarse-graining. Beyond robustness, we show that response-driven structural adaptation generates intrinsic parameter flows that attract the system toward this surface without external fine tuning. Together, these results unify loop renormalization and adaptive response in a single framework and establish a concrete route to autonomous criticali",

Simulations and analysis reveal two emergent behaviors: path straightening in homogeneous environments and path refraction at material interfaces, both consistent with experimental observations of insect trails.

We demonstrate that ISR admits a stable mixed equilibrium of ISR and unconditional defection (ALLD), and that costly punishment can become productive: When sufficiently efficient, it raises collective welfare above the no-punishment baseline.

The Koopman autoencoder employs a learned linear temporal operator in latent space, enabling eigenvalue regularization to promote temporal stability. This strategy is evaluated alongside temporal unrolling techniques for achieving stable and accurate long-term predictions. The models are assessed on three test cases spanning distinct dynamical regimes, with prediction horizons up to one year at 30-minute temporal ",

This constraint is most apparent in melting systems, where temperature remains pinned despite continued energy input.

We show that energy conservation alone enforces a rigorous duality between the total latent heat dissipated during phase change and the accumulated exceedance of the latent temperature above the melting point. This duality is mathematically equivalent to the one-dimensional Wasserstein-1 distance between the latent and observed temperature trajectories, with the transport cost set by",

However, because of this focus on shorter timescales, many of these emulators ignore the effects of the ocean, and take no ocean variables as inputs. We hypothesise that such MLWP models have learnt a best-guess of the evolution of the atmosphere, by implicitly inferring ocean conditions from atmospheric states, with no access to ocean data. Turning this limitation into a strength, we use it as a means to study the role of the oceans on the evolution of the atmosphere. By exploring how",

      "summary": "Self Attraction and Loading (SAL), which includes the deformation of the solid Earth under the load of the ocean tide and the self-gravitation of the so-deformed Earth as well as of the ocean tides themselves, is an important term to include in numerical models of the ocean tides. Computing SAL is a challenging problem that is usually tackled using spherical harmonics. The spherical harmonic approach has several drawbacks which limit its accuracy. In this work, we propose an alternative technique based on a spherical convolution. We implement the convolution technique in the Modular Ocean Model, version 6, and demonstrate that it allows for more accurate tides when measured against tidal datasets based upon satellite altimetry. The convolution based SAL reduces the error by reducing spurio",

At the same time, the realism of data-driven weather forecasts is often questioned and considered as an Achilles' heel of machine learning models.

We demonstrate numerically that our method improves energy balance in long-term turbulent simulations and also accurately reproduces individual solutions.

      "summary": "Tornadoes and other severe weather hazards affect thousands of people every year. Despite this, the details surrounding tornadic processes including formation, decay, and longevity are not well understood, partially due to limitations of available instrumentation. Measurements of atmospheric pressure within tornadic systems currently rely almost entirely on in-situ instrumentation, and no existing techniques can provide two-dimensional spatial information of the atmospheric density field. Atmospheric muons may hold a solution to this problem: muons are attenuated by matter, and tornadic storms are large regions of low atmospheric density, suggesting that tornadic storms induce a directional perturbation on the atmospheric muon flux. Measurements of this perturbation could then be used to i",

      "summary": "We present a new adaptive particle-based data assimilation scheme for cryospheric applications that leverages promising developments in importance sampling. The proposed approach seeks to combine some of the advantages of two widely used classes of schemes: particle methods and iterative ensemble Kalman methods. Specifically, it extends the PBS that is commonly used in cryospheric data assimilation, with the AMIS algorithm. This adaptive formulation transforms the PBS into an iterative scheme with improved resilience against ensemble collapse and the ability to implement early-stopping strategies. As such, computational cost is automatically adapted to the complexity of the problem at hand, even down to the grid-cell and water year level in distributed multiyear simulations. In homage to t",

Both models adapt the properties of their ensembles to the type of event, either convective or stratiform. The spatial scores of the STEPS and LDCast ensembles are compared with those of surrogate ensembles having some key properties, revealing that both STEPS and LDCast have very little ability to spatially localise the ensemble mean error vector through their ensemble members.

The physics of ice melting involves a non-trivial interplay between thermodynamics at the interface, hydrodynamic transport in the bulk and the properties of the ambient ocean. The key control parameters are the density ratio $R_ρ$ proportional to the ambient ocean salinity and the Lewis number $Le = κ_T/κ_S$, which compares the thermal and salt diffusivities. Increasing the salinity is known to slow down melting, with the melt rate transitioning from subdiffusive to diffusive as $R_ρ$ increases. Here, we ssess the role of turbulence in this transition, using highly-resolved numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations with a slowly melting upper boundar",

Killing all 1.3 billion sheep would lead to a temperature change of -0.004 C. New Zealand's pledge to reduce methane emissions of their livestock by 14% to 24% from those in the year 2017 would change the temperature by -0.000005 to -0.000008 C, far too small to measure. These are maximum temperature savings where methane emissions from domestic livestock are not replaced by other sources (such as wild ruminants and termites) during the inevitable rewilding of managed grasslands and rangelands.",

A transformation of the radiosonde's temperature and relative humidity profiles into a simulated optical backscatter signal is implemented via the model, which includes a critical rate-limiting activation step. By comparing this simulated signal with the ceilometer's measured data, the model can determine the minimum effective size of dust particles required to act as cloud condensation nuclei.

Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial eleva",

However, simply comparing predictions to observations is insufficient for understanding the global landscape of model behavior. This is especially true for many deep learning models, whose structures are complex. Further, in risk-averse operational settings, water managers require models that are trustworthy and provably safe, as non-robustness can put our critical infrastructure at risk. Motivated by the need to select reliable models for operational deployment, we introduce and explore adversarial robustness analysis in hydrological modeling, evaluating whether small, targeted perturbations to meteorological forcings induce substantial changes in simulated discharge.

We find that phase diagrams at different inner-core pressures collapse when temperatures are scaled by the melting temperature of pure iron, indicating that solid-liquid partitioning is controlled primarily by a reduced temperature relative to iron melting and is weakly sensitive to pressure.

Theoretical models suggest that the Moon could act as a resonant detector, but the unknown influence of its rugged surface and heterogeneous interior has cast doubt on this prospect. Here, we resolve this long-standing uncertainty by constructing the first high-resolution, structurally realistic model of the lunar GW response. We achieve this by combining high-fidelity spectral-element simulations with the analytical power of normal-mode perturbation theory, thereby resolving topographical effects down to $3.7$ km grid spacing while maintaining the capacity to discern global free-oscillation patterns.

Conventional grid-based numerical methods, such as finite-difference and finite-element approaches, often require dense discretization and repeated forward simulations, leading to high computational cost in inverse problems. Although deep learning has shown promise in seismic applications, its performance is commonly limited by the need for large labeled datasets and weak enforcement of physical constraints.   In this study, we propose a unified physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for forward modeling and parameter inversion of viscoacoustic wave propagation.

By introducing these descriptors as a third modality, our approach encourages the learned embeddings to capture intrinsic geological semantics rather than superficial signal correlations.

However, a specific mechanism for a sudden tipping to an alternate stable state, several degrees warmer than the present climate, has yet to be presented.

These properties can be measured by tracking the propagation of elastic waves within the ice.

      "summary": "The M8.8 Kamchatka earthquake on July 29, 2025 was one of the largest in the first quarter of the 21st century. It deserves a thorough analysis including the preparation process. A smaller M7.4 earthquake occurred on July 20 with its epicenter within the confidence ellipse for the July 29 event. The aftershock sequence of the July 20 earthquake and the evolution of seismicity within the Kamchatka Peninsula region during 10 days period before the July 29 event may provide important information on the earthquake preparation and initiation processes. The CTBTO's International Monitoring System is one of the most sensitive global seismic networks comprising high-resolution array stations with enhanced sensitivity relative to three-component stations at the same locations.

      "summary": "Inferring high-dimensional physical states from sparse, ad-hoc sensor arrays is a fundamental challenge across AI for Science, yet standard architectures like CNNs and DeepSets struggle to capture the irregular geometries and relational physics inherent to domains like seismology. To address this, we propose SourceNet, a Transformer-based framework that bridges the profound Sim-to-Real gap via Physics-Structured Domain Randomization (PSDR), a protocol that randomizes governing physical dynamics to enforce invariance to unmodeled environmental heterogeneity. By pre-training on 100,000 synthetic events and fine-tuning on ~2,500 real-world events, SourceNet achieves state-of-the-art precision on held-out real data, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and real-time capability compared to",

It describes the capacity of a system to cope with, adapt to and innovate in response to a changing surrounding. Given the current climate change crisis, ensuring conditions for a sustainable future for the habitability on the planet is fundamentally dependent on Earth System (ES) resilience. It is thus particularly relevant to establish a model that captures and frames resilience of the ES, most particularly in physical terms that can be influenced by human policy\\footnote{See page 4 for examples of strategies}.

While reliable interpolation of EGFs at unsampled locations could enhance tomographic resolution, the task remains inherently challenging and underexplored due to the dispersive nature of EGFs.

Several studies have analysed the spatio-temporal evolution and processes driving each sequence, focusing mainly on the foreshock--mainshock--aftershock periods. Here, we focus on the 2018--2024 interseismic phase, aiming to unravel the long-term seismogenic behaviour of this region. We first relocated the earthquake catalogue and identified clusters through a declustering algorithm. During this phase, background seismicity and most clusters were arranged in a 2--3 km thick low-angle layer. We found ",

Here, we dissect this co-evolutionary feedback by coupling a public goods game with an epidemic model on complex networks, including multiplex and real-world networks. Our results reveals a dichotomy in how heterogeneity shapes outcomes. We demonstrate that structural heterogeneity in social networks acts as a powerful catalyst for cooperation and disease suppression. This emergent effect is driven by highly connected hubs who, facing amplified personal risk, adopt protective strategies out of self-interest. In contrast, heterogeneity in individual infection costs proves detrimental, undermin",

      "summary": "We develop a statistical framework for wealth allocation in which agents hold discrete units of wealth and macrostates are defined by how wealth is distributed across agents. The structure of the economic state space is characterized through a value convertibility function, which captures how effectively additional wealth can be transformed into productive or meaningful value. The derivative of this function determines the effective number of internally distinct configurations available to an agent at a given wealth level. In a closed setting with fixed total wealth and a fixed number of agents, we show that equilibrium wealth distributions follow directly from unbiased counting of admissible configurations and may display a condensation phenomenon, where a finite fraction of total wealth ",

Each individual has a default strategy of either cooperating ($C$) or defecting ($D$). Two strategies were tested, including ``tit-for-tat'' (TFT), in which individuals play their opponent's last play, or simply playing their default play. Each individual also has a probability of telling the truth ($0 \\leq P_{truth} \\leq 1$) about their last play. This parameter, which can evolve over time, allows individuals to be, for instance, a defector but present as a cooperator regarding their last play. This leads to interesting dynamics where mixed populations of defectors and cooperators with $P_{truth} \\geq 0.75$ move toward populations of truth-telling cooperators. Likewise, mixed populations wi",

This attention seems to be driven by the many social issues that strongly depend on people's opinions (such as climate change and vaccination) and the need for empirically valid models to design related policy interventions. While different models have been combined in various ways with empirical data, standardised comparison of models against empirical data is still lacking. In this article, we test the validity of multiple opinion dynamics models--including both stylized and more realistic models. Our approach follows a \"data science-like\" validation procedure, where we first calibrate the model's free parameter",

Results show that over this period, social cohesion, quantified as average closure in the network, declines by more than 15%. We demonstrate that the decline is not due to changes in demographic composition, but to rewiring in individual ego networks.

To overcome this limitation, we establish a co-evolutionary framework that couples moral assessment, strategy updating, and environmental dynamics, allowing the payoff structure to dynamically adjust in response to the ecological consequences of collective actions.

We then systematically examine the effectiveness and applicability of this similarity measure through two fundamental tasks: link prediction and community detection. To address the scarcity of cycles in link prediction, an edge-addition correction strategy is introduced, whereby the existence ",

      "summary": "Human behavior plays a critical role in shaping epidemic trajectories. During health crises, people respond in diverse ways in terms of self-protection and adherence to recommended measures, largely reflecting differences in how individuals assess risk. This behavioral variability induces effective heterogeneity into key epidemic parameters, such as infectivity and susceptibility. We introduce a minimal extension of the susceptible-infected-removed~(SIR) model, denoted HeSIR, that captures these effects through a simple bimodal scheme, where individuals may have higher or lower transmission--related traits. We derive a closed-form expression for the epidemic threshold in terms of the model parameters, and the network's degree distribution and homophily, defined as the tendency of like--ris",

Although previous work has shown that reputation can promote cooperation in such systems, most models introduce reputation by modifying payoffs, encoding it directly in the state or changing partner selection, which makes it difficult to isolate the role of the learning signal itself. Here, we construct the reinforcement signal as a weighted combination of reputation and game payoffs, leaving the game and network structure unchanged. We find that increasing the weight on reputation generally promotes cooperation by consolidating clusters, but this effect is conditional on the learning dynamics. Specifically, this p",

Remarkably, we show that these hypergraph features have a fundamental effect on the critical properties of hypergraph percolation, reshaping criticality in a way that depends on network structure.

      "summary": "The Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) poses a significant challenge for exotic derivatives pricing, particularly for non-modelable risk factors (NMRF) where sparse market data leads to infinite audit bounds under classical Martingale Optimal Transport (MOT). We propose a unified Rough Martingale Optimal Transport (RMOT) framework that regularizes the transport plan with a rough volatility prior, yielding finite, explicit, and asymptotically tight extrapolation bounds. We establish an identifiability theorem for rough volatility parameters under sparse data, proving that 50 strikes are sufficient to estimate the Hurst exponent within $\\pm 0.05$. For the multi-asset case, we prove that the correlation matrix is locally identifiable from marginal option surfaces provided the Hurst",

      "summary": "We study U.S. Treasury yield curve forecasting under distributional uncertainty and recast forecasting as an operations research and managerial decision problem. Rather than minimizing average forecast error, the forecaster selects a decision rule that minimizes worst case expected loss over an ambiguity set of forecast error distributions. To this end, we propose a distributionally robust ensemble forecasting framework that integrates parametric factor models with high dimensional nonparametric machine learning models through adaptive forecast combinations. The framework consists of three machine learning components. First, a rolling window Factor Augmented Dynamic Nelson Siegel model captures level, slope, and curvature dynamics using principal components extracted from economic indicato",

We compare agent behavior under Ethereum's default 12-second slot time environment with a faster regime that offers 1-second subslot execution. The simulations, calibrated to Binance and Uniswap v3 data from July to September 2025, show that faster slot times increase arbitrage transaction count by 535% and trading volume by 203% on average.

In our empirical application, we recover risk-neutral correlations and joint tail risk from FX options alone, addressing a longstanding measurement problem raised",

      "summary": "The balancing market in the energy sector plays a critical role in physically and financially balancing the supply and demand. Modeling dynamics in the balancing market can provide valuable insights and prognosis for power grid stability and secure energy supply. While complex machine learning models can achieve high accuracy, their black-box nature severely limits the model interpretability. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability for the energy balancing market. Particularly, we take the example of forecasting manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR) activation price in the balancing market using real market data from different energy price zones. We explore the interpretability of mFRR forecasting using two models: extreme gradient boosting",

Here we analyse a panel of 900 European power firms (2001-2023) to resolve whether these profits reflect a durable profitability advantage or a crisis-driven anomaly. Using machine-learning clustering and Bayesian model averaging, we identify a structural divergence: wind and solar portfolios exhibit rising profitability, with return on assets among wind-dominated firms increasing by over 6% between 2014 and 2023. Conversely, higher fossil portfolio shares are increasingly associated with lower profitability, with marginal effects reaching -4% by 2023, while renewable-dominated fi",

To operationalize this perspective, the paper introduces the Geopolitical-Adaptive Efficiency Ratio (GAER), a descriptive cross-sectional indicator measuring the concentration of adaptive-efficiency-supporting mass within institutionally and geopolitically central assets.

      "summary": "We develop an economic model of decentralised exchanges (DEXs) in which risk-averse liquidity providers (LPs) manage risk in a centralised exchange (CEX) based on preferences, information, and trading costs. Rational, risk-averse LPs anticipate the frictions associated with replication and manage risk primarily by reducing the reserves supplied to the DEX. Greater aversion reduces the equilibrium viability of liquidity provision, resulting in thinner markets and lower trading volumes. Greater uninformed demand supports deeper liquidity, whereas higher fundamental price volatility erodes it. Finally, while moderate anticipated price changes can improve LP performance, larger changes require more intensive trading in the CEX, generate higher replication costs, and induce LPs to reduce liquid",

Previous work has shown that US bond yields decline around the release of a sample of mostly proprietary AI models (Andrews and Farboodi 2025). I extend this analysis to include also open weight AI models that can be freely used and modified. I find long-term bond yields shift in opposite directions following the introduction of open versus closed models. Patterns are similar for treasuries, corporate bonds, and TIPS. The different movements suggest that that markets may anticipate open and closed AI advances to have different economic implications, and that the cumulative impact of AI releases on bond yields may be more muted.",

Current model-risk frameworks assume static, well-specified algorithms and one-time validations; large language models and multi-agent trading systems violate those assumptions by learning continuously, exchanging latent signals, and exhibiting emergent behavior. Drawing on complex adaptive systems theory, we model these technologies as decentralized ensembles whose risks propagate along multiple time-scales. We then propose a modular governance architecture. The framework decomposes oversight into four layers of \"regulatory blocks\": (i) self-regulation modules embedded beside each model, (ii) firm-level governance blocks that aggregate local telemetry and enforce policy,",

This information loss is particularly severe when numerical and object entities are removed from texts and is amplified in texts characterized by high linguistic uncertainty and firm specificity. Importantly, in the setting of sentiment extraction from earnings call transcripts, we find that information loss induced by anonymization is more pervasive and severe than the effects of look-ahead bias, suggesting that the costs of anonymization may outweigh its benefits in certain financial applications.",

I show that narratives extracted from earnings calls significantly improve the prediction of both realized earnings and analyst expectations. To uncover the underlying mechanisms, I introduce a novel text-morphing methodology in which large language models generate counterfactual transcripts that systematically vary topical emphasis (the prevailing narrative) while holding quantitative content fixed. This framework allows me to precisely measure how analysts under- and over-react to specific narrative dimensions. The results reveal systematic biases: analysts over-react to sentiment (optimism) and under-react to narrativ",

The bias is particularly severe during volatile periods, over long horizons, and when event timing correlates with market conditions. We derive precise conditions for identification and expressions for asymptotic bias. As an alternative, we propose synthetic control methods that construct replicating portfolios from control securities without imposing specific factor structures.

However, understanding the real risk-return trade-off and what factors affect future crypto returns is crucial as crypto becomes increasingly accessible to retail investors through major brokerages. We examine the HODL strategy through two independent analyses. First, we implement 480 million Monte Carlo simulations across 378 non-stablecoin crypto assets, net of trading fees and the opportunity cost of 1-month Treasury bills, and find strong evidence of survivorship bias and extreme downside concentration.

This Asia-focused bank --in spite of it all-- grew from these conditions into the behemoth it is today.

Modeling uncertainty via a Wasserstein ambiguity set, we confront the structural obstacle of~``concave-max'' geometry arising from maximizing a concave utility against an adversarial distribution. Unlike standard convex loss minimization, the dual reformulation here requires a minimax interchange within the semi-infinite constraints, where the utility's concavity precludes exact strong duality.

Using a quadratic measure of network spillovers derived from a connectedness matrix, we formulate a three-objective optimization problem and characterize the resulting three-dimensional efficient surface. We establish existence, uniqueness, and continuity of",

This paper adopts the Smart Predict--then--Optimize (SPO) paradigm for portfolio optimization in real markets, which explicitly aligns the learning objective with downstream portfolio decision quality rather than pointwise prediction accuracy. Within this paradigm, predictive models are trained using an SPO-based surrogate loss that directly reflects the performance of the resulting investment decisions. To preserve interpretability and robustness, we employ linear predictors built on return-based and technical-indicator features and integrate them with portfolio optimization models that incorporate transaction",

We propose a simple change: sort assets using uncertainty-adjusted prediction bounds instead of point predictions alone. Across a broad set of ML models and a U.S. equity panel, this approach improves portfolio performance relative to point-prediction sorting. These gains persist even when bounds are built from partial or misspecified uncertainty information. They arise mainly from reduced volatility and are strongest for flexible machine learning models. Identification and robustness exercises show that these improvements are driven by asset-level rather than time or aggregate predictive uncertainty.",

This paper revisits these two beliefs within a unified probabilistic framework. We define risk at the expectation level as a property of the generating distribution of cumulative investment outcomes, and distinguish it from uncertainty, understood as the dispersion of realized outcomes across possible paths.

The gain PDF has the advantage of being 1-dimensional for any given portfolio and thus is easy to visualize and interpret. The framework allows us to naturally incorporate all existing approaches (Markowitz, CVaR-deviation, higher moments...) and represents an interesting basis to develop new approaches. It leads us to propose a method to directly match a target PDF defined by the portfolio manager, giving them maximal control on the PO problem and moving beyond approaches that focus only on expected return and risk.

Recent literature has introduced the concept of local balance as a measure of the contribution of a single node to the overall balance of the network. In the present research, we investigate the potential of using deviations of local balance from global balance as a criterion for selecting outperforming assets. The underlying idea is that, during financial crises, most assets in the investment universe behave similarly: losses are severe and widespread, and the global balance of the correlation-based signed network reaches its maximum value. Under such circumstances, standard diversification (mainly related to portfolio size) is unable to reduce risk or limit losses. Therefore, it may be useful to concentrate",

We propose to use the quantile regression forest in the offline-simulation-online-estimation (OSOA) framework. Specifically, the quantile regression forest is trained offline to learn the relationship between the online VaR and risk factors, and real-time VaR estimates are then produced online by incorporating observed risk factors. To further ensure reliability, we develop a conformalized estimator that calibrates the online VaR estimates. To the best of our k",

In a heavy-tailed regime, characterized by decreasing hazard rates or increasing reverse hazard rates, the SD dominates the GMD. Conversely, when both tails of the distribution are light, the GMD dominates the SD. These dominance regimes are shown to be stable under truncation, convolution, and mixtures.

Assuming that updates of the available carbon budget follow a diffusion process, we identify the emission strategy that maximizes expected discounted emissions under the constraint of a non-increasing emission rate, with an additional term rewarding the amount of time for which the budget is not yet depleted.",

This paper studies the performance of two simulation-based VaR estimation approaches, importance sampling and discrete moment matching, under controlled tail misspecification. The analysis separates the nominal model used for estimator construction from the true data-generating process used for evaluation, allowing the effects of heavy-tailed returns to be examined in a transparent and reproducible setting. Daily returns of a broad equity market proxy are used to calibrate a nominal Gaussian model, while true returns are generated from Student-t distributions with varying degrees of freedom to represent increasingly heavy tai",

Therefore, we propose surveillance schemes for systemic risk, which allow to detect misspecified systemic risk forecasts in an \"online\" fashion.

Such online schemes are vital in taking timely countermeasures to avoid financial distress. Our monitoring procedures allow multiple series at once to be monitored, thus increasing the likelihood and the speed at which early signs of trouble may be picked up. The tests hold size by construction, such that the null of correct systemic risk assessments is only rejected during the monitoring period with (at most) ",

Then it models the monthly evolution of PDs using higher-frequency behavioral data.

      "summary": "This paper measures price differences between Hegic option quotes on Arbitrum and a model-based benchmark built on Black--Scholes model with regime-sensitive volatility estimated via a two-regime MS-AR-(GJR)-GARCH model. Using option-level feasible GLS, we find benchmark prices exceed Hegic quotes on average, especially for call options. The price spread rises with order size, strike, maturity, and estimated volatility, and falls with trading volume. By underlying, wrapped Bitcoin options show larger and more persistent spreads, while Ethereum options are closer to the benchmark. The framework offers a data-driven analysis for monitoring and calibrating on-chain option pricing logic.",

Four different approaches to estimate the VVIX in the Heston model are presented: two based on the known transition density of the variance, one analytical approximation, and one based on the Heston PDE which computes the value directly out of the underlying SPX500.

This model has a natural scaling limit that reconciles a number of salient empirical properties: persistent signed order flow, rough trading volume and volatility, and power-law market impact. In our framework, all these quantities are pinned down by a single statistic $H_0$, which measures the persistence of the core flow. Specifically, the signed flow converges to the sum of a fractional process with Hurst index $H_0$ and a martingale, while the limiting traded volume is a rough process with Hurst index $H_0-1/2$. No-arbitrage constraints imply that volatility is rough, with Hurst parameter $2H_0-3/2$, and that ",

We identify the root cause in the neglect of financial asymmetry and rare tail events, which strongly affect market risk but are often overlooked by objectives focusing on distribution matching.

      "summary": "We analyze daily lead-time distributions for two Airbnb demand metrics, Nights Booked (volume) and Gross Booking Value (revenue), treating each day's allocation across 0-365 days as a compositional vector. The data span 2,557 days from January 2019 through December 2025 in a large North American region. Three findings emerge. First, GBV concentrates more heavily in mid-range horizons: beyond 90 days, GBV tail mass typically exceeds Nights by 20-50%, with ratios reaching 75% at the 180-day threshold during peak seasons. Second, Gamma and Weibull distributions fit comparably well under interval-censored cross-entropy. Gamma wins on 61% of days for Nights and 52% for GBV, with Weibull close behind at 38% and 45%. Lognormal rarely wins (<3%). Nonparametric GAMs achieve 18-80x lower CRPS but sa",

      "summary": "The rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model, characterised by its roughness parameter $H$, has been shown to exhibit multiscaling behaviour as $H$ approaches zero. Multiscaling has profound implications for financial modelling: it affects extreme risk estimation, influences optimal portfolio allocation across different time horizons, and challenges traditional option pricing approaches that assume uniscaling behaviours. Understanding whether multiscaling arises primarily from the roughness of volatility paths or from the resulting fat-tailed returns has important implications for financial modelling, option pricing, and risk management. This paper investigates the real source of this multiscaling behaviour by introducing a novel two-stage statistical testing procedure. In the first stage, we establ",

The mLog S-fBM is constructed by modeling volatility components as exponentials of the mS-fBM, preserving the dependence structure of the Gaussian core.

      "summary": "We use a $φ^{4}$ quantum field theory with inhomogeneous couplings and explicit symmetry-breaking to model an ensemble of financial time series from the S$\\&$P 500 index. The continuum nature of the $φ^4$ theory avoids the inaccuracies that occur in Ising-based models which require a discretization of the time series. We demonstrate this using the example of the 2008 global financial crisis. The $φ^{4}$ quantum field theory is expressive enough to reproduce the higher-order statistics such as the market kurtosis, which can serve as an indicator of possible market shocks. Accurate reproduction of high kurtosis is absent in binarized models. Therefore Ising models, despite being widely employed in econophysics, are incapable of fully representing empirical financial data, a limitation not pr",

For the latter, we introduce a new approach to obtain Berry-Esseen inequalities for nonlinear functions of sum statistics under some convexity assumptions. Our theoretical contributions cover both one- and two-sample empirical relative entropies. We then detail a change-point detection procedure built on relative entropy and ",

Comparing two normal populations, the sample size calculation requires specification of the variance other than the treatment effect and misspecification can lead to underpowered studies. Blinded sample size re-estimation is an approach to minimize the risk of inconclusive studies. Existing methods proposed to use the total (one-sample) variance that is estimable from blinded data without knowledge of the treatment allocation. We demonstrate that, since the expectation of this estimator is greater than or equal to the true variance, the one-sample variance approach can be regarded as providing an upper bound of the variance in blind reviews.

We present a new tool (available at https://github.com/KevinMcK95/gaia_roman_astrometry) to simulate the astrometric precision that will be achieved when combining Gaia data with Roman images. We construct realistic Roman position uncertainties as a function of filter, magnitude, and exposure time, which are combined with Gaia precisions and user-defined Roman observing strategies to predict the expected uncertainty in position, parallax, and proper motion (PM). We also simulate the core Roman surveys to assess their end-of-mission astrometric capabilities, finding that the High Latitude and Galactic Bulge Time Domain Surveys will deliver Gaia-DR3-qual",

However, EHR are collected for patient care rather than research, so typically have complexities, such as patients with missing baseline disease status. Prevalence-Incidence (PI) models, which use a two-component mixture model to account for this missing data, have been proposed. However, PI models are biased in settings in which some individuals will never experience the endpoint (they are 'cured'). To address this, we propose a Prevalence Incidence Cure (PIC) model, a 3 component mixture model that combines the PI model framework with a cure model. Our PIC model enables estimation of the prevalence, time-to-in",

Using data from the 2018 wave of the Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (Baby FACES), we applied a three-level generalized additive latent and mixed model (GALAMM) to distinguish genuine classroom-level variability in process quality, as measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) and Quality of Caregiver-",

Simulation studies demonstrate that IRFL achieves accurate changepoint detection across a wide range of challenging scenarios, including those involving nuisance factors such as trends, seasonal patterns, and serially correlated errors.

      "summary": "We analyze two classical algorithms for solving additively composite convex optimization problems where the objective is the sum of a smooth term and a nonsmooth regularizer: proximal stochastic gradient method for a single regularizer; and the randomized incremental proximal method, which uses the proximal operator of a randomly selected function when the regularizer is given as the sum of many nonsmooth functions. We focus on relaxing the bounded variance assumption that is common, yet stringent, for getting last iterate convergence rates. We prove the $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate of convergence for the last iterate of both algorithms under componentwise convexity and smoothness, which is optimal up to log terms. Our results apply directly to graph-guided regularizers that arise in m",

      "summary": "A simple strategy for improving LLM accuracy, especially in math and reasoning problems, is to sample multiple responses and submit the answer most consistently reached. In this paper we leverage Bayesian prior information to save on sampling costs, stopping once sufficient consistency is reached. Although the exact posterior is computationally intractable, we further introduce an efficient \"L-aggregated\" stopping policy that tracks only the L-1 most frequent answer counts. Theoretically, we prove that L=3 is all you need: this coarse approximation is sufficient to achieve asymptotic optimality, and strictly dominates prior-free baselines, while having a fast posterior computation. Empirically, this identifies the most consistent (i.e., mode) LLM answer using fewer samples, and can achieve",

We study logarithmic-time scheduling, in which the optimizer's gradient memory horizon grows with training time.

      "summary": "Setting the learning rate for a deep learning model is a critical part of successful training, yet choosing this hyperparameter is often done empirically with trial and error. In this work, we explore a solvable model of optimal learning rate schedules for a powerlaw random feature model trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We consider the optimal schedule $η_T^\\star(t)$ where $t$ is the current iterate and $T$ is the total training horizon. This schedule is computed both numerically and analytically (when possible) using optimal control methods. Our analysis reveals two regimes which we term the easy phase and hard phase. In the easy phase the optimal schedule is a polynomial decay $η_T^\\star(t) \\simeq T^{-ξ} (1-t/T)^δ$ where $ξ$ and $δ$ depend on the properties of the features",

      "summary": "Gradient-variation online learning has drawn increasing attention due to its deep connections to game theory, optimization, etc. It has been studied extensively in the full-information setting, but is underexplored with bandit feedback. In this work, we focus on gradient variation in Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) with two-point feedback. By proposing a refined analysis on the non-consecutive gradient variation, a fundamental quantity in gradient variation with bandits, we improve the dimension dependence for both convex and strongly convex functions compared with the best known results (Chiang et al., 2013). Our improved analysis for the non-consecutive gradient variation also implies other favorable problem-dependent guarantees, such as gradient-variance and small-loss regrets. Beyond ",

To this end, we propose the Conditional Counterfactual Mean Embeddings (CCME), a framework that embeds conditional distributions of counterfactual outcomes into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Under this framework, we develop a two-stage meta-estimator for CCME that accommodates any RKHS-valued regression in each stage. Based on this meta-estimator, we develop three practical CCME estimators: (1) Ridge Regression estimator, (2) Deep Feature estimator that parameterizes the feature map by a neural network, and (3) Neural-Kernel estimator that performs RKHS-valued regression, with the coefficients parameterized by a neural network.

Especially energy systems are difficult to handle as they exhibit instantaneous as well as delayed effects and if equipped with storage, do have a memory. In this paper we adapt the causal root-cause analysis method of Budhathoki et al. [2022] to general time-dependent systems, as it can be regarded as a strictly causal definition of the term \"root-cause\". Particularly, we discuss two truncation approaches to handle the infinite dependency graphs present in time-dependent systems. While one leaves the causal mechanisms intact, the other approximates the mechanisms at the start nodes. The effectiveness of the different approaches is benchmarked using a challenging data generation process inspir",

In this paper, we introduce the targeted synthetic control (TSC) method, a new two-stage estimator that directly estimates the counterfactual outcome. Specifically, our TSC method (1) yields a targeted debiasing estimator, in the sense that the targeted updating refines the initial weights to produce more stable weights; and (2) ensures that the final counterfactual estimation is a convex combination of observed control outcomes to enable direct interpretation of the synthetic control weights. TSC is flexible and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine ",

      "summary": "TabPFN is a transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance on supervised tabular tasks by amortizing Bayesian prediction into a single forward pass. However, there is currently no method for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN. Because it behaves, in an idealised limit, as a Bayesian in-context learner, we cast the decomposition challenge as a Bayesian predictive inference (BPI) problem. The main computational tool in BPI, predictive Monte Carlo, is challenging to apply here as it requires simulating unmodeled covariates. We therefore pursue the asymptotic alternative, filling a gap in the theory for supervised settings by proving a predictive CLT under quasi-martingale conditions. We derive variance estimators determined by the volatility of predictive updates along the context. T",

Our key innovation is a formal power series expansion of the loss evolution, with coefficients encoded by diagrams akin to Feynman diagrams. We show that this expansion has a well-defined large-size limit that can be used to reveal different learning phases and, in some cases, to obtain explicit solutions of the nonlinear GF. We focus on learning Canonical Polyadic (CP) decompositions of high-order tensors, and show that this model has several distinct extreme lazy and rich GF regimes such as free evolution, NTK and under- and over-parameterized mean-field.
