        "abstract": "High-fidelity generative video editing has seen significant quality improvements by leveraging pre-trained video foundation models. However, their computational cost is a major bottleneck, as they are often designed to inefficiently process the full video context regardless of the inpainting mask's size, even for sparse, localized edits. In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation.",

        "abstract": "We introduce the Sphere Encoder, an efficient generative framework capable of producing images in a single forward pass and competing with many-step diffusion models using fewer than five steps. Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto a spherical latent space, and a decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding a random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder a few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with a small fraction of the inference cost.

        "abstract": "Although learned representations underlie neural networks' success, their fundamental properties remain poorly understood. A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in privacy-critical and personalization-oriented scenarios, yet the role of context length in shaping privacy leakage and personalization effectiveness remains largely unexplored. We introduce a large-scale benchmark, PAPerBench, to systematically study how increasing context length influences both personalization quality and privacy protection in LLMs. The benchmark comprises approximately 29,000 instances with context lengths ranging from 1K to 256K tokens, yielding a total of 377K evaluation questions. It jointly evaluates personalization performance and privacy risks across diverse scenarios, enabling controlled analysis of long-context model behavior. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal consistent performance degradation in both personalization and privacy as context length increases. We further provide a theoretical analysis of attention dilution under context scaling, explaining this behavior as an inherent limitation of soft attention in fixed-capacity Transformers. The empirical and theoretical findings together suggest a general scaling gap in current models -- long context, less focus. We release the benchmark to support reproducible evaluation and future research on scalable privacy and personalization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/PAPerBench",

        "abstract": "Many generative tasks in chemistry and science involve distributions invariant to group symmetries (e.g., permutation and rotation). A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \\times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation. Moreover, with a novel architecture Canon, CanonFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging GEOM-DRUG dataset, and the advantage remains large in few-step generation.",

        "abstract": "Cross-survey generalization is a critical challenge in stellar spectral analysis, particularly in cases such as transferring from low- to moderate-resolution surveys. We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration.",

        "abstract": "Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English channels. Recent data suggests >85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total; a growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at ~30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface \"under-the-radar\" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high-recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucinations. We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. We compare Bioptic Agent against Claude Opus 4.6, OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro, Perplexity Deep Research, Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research, and Exa Websets. Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 versus 56.2% (Claude Opus 4.6), 50.6% (Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research), 46.6% (GPT-5.2 Pro), 44.2% (Perplexity Deep Research), and 26.9% (Exa Websets). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results.",

It can also simulate agile dynamics of multi-rotor vehicles in complex and dynamic environments. Neurosim can achieve frame rates as high as ~2700 FPS on a desktop GPU. Neurosim integrates with a ZeroMQ-based communication library called Cortex to facilitate seamless integration with machine learning and robotics workflows. Cortex provides a high-throughput, low-latency message-passing system for Python and C++ applications, with native support for NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors. This paper discusses the design philosophy behind Neurosim and Cortex. It demonstrates how they can be used to (i) train neuromorphic perception and control algorithms, e.g., using self-supervised learning on time-synchronized multi-modal data, and (ii) test real-time implementations of these algorithms in closed-loop.

        "abstract": "Diffusion language models are a promising alternative to autoregressive models due to their potential for faster generation. Among discrete diffusion approaches, Masked diffusion currently dominates, largely driven by strong perplexity on language modeling benchmarks. In this work, we present the first scaling law study of uniform-state and interpolating discrete diffusion methods. We also show that Masked diffusion models can be made approximately 12% more FLOPs-efficient when trained with a simple cross-entropy objective. We find that perplexity is informative within a diffusion family but can be misleading across families, where models with worse likelihood scaling may be preferable due to faster and more practical sampling, as reflected by the speed-quality Pareto frontier. These results challenge the view that Masked diffusion is categorically the future of diffusion language modeling and that perplexity alone suffices for cross-algorithm comparison. Scaling all methods to 1.7B parameters, we show that uniform-state diffusion remains competitive on likelihood-based benchmarks and outperforms autoregressive and Masked diffusion models on GSM8K, despite worse validation perplexity.

Addressing the scarcity of parallel corpora that map between styles, the study employs roundtrip translation to synthesize such parallel datasets from monolingual corpora. This approach creates 'neutralized' text devoid of stylistic attributes, essentially creating a shared input style at training-time and inference-time. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority of this method over zero-shot prompting and fewshot ICL techniques measured by BLEU scores and style accuracy scores across four investigated domains. Furthermore, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for terminology and name knowledge enhances robustness and stylistic consistency.",

        "abstract": "Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.",

        "abstract": "Many robot tasks require attending to the history of past observations. For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion models over discrete spaces have recently shown striking empirical success, yet their theoretical foundations remain incomplete. In this paper, we study the sampling efficiency of score-based discrete diffusion models under a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) formulation, with a focus on $τ$-leaping-based samplers. We establish sharp convergence guarantees for attaining $\\varepsilon$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for both uniform and masking noising processes. For uniform discrete diffusion, we show that the $τ$-leaping algorithm achieves an iteration complexity of order $\\tilde O(d/\\varepsilon)$, with $d$ the ambient dimension of the target distribution, eliminating linear dependence on the vocabulary size $S$ and improving existing bounds by a factor of $d$; moreover, we establish a matching algorithmic lower bound showing that linear dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable in general. For masking discrete diffusion, we introduce a modified $τ$-leaping sampler whose convergence rate is governed by an intrinsic information-theoretic quantity, termed the effective total correlation, which is bounded by $d \\log S$ but can be sublinear or even constant for structured data. As a consequence, the sampler provably adapts to low-dimensional structure without prior knowledge or algorithmic modification, yielding sublinear convergence rates for various practical examples (such as hidden Markov models, image data, and random graphs). Our analysis requires no boundedness or smoothness assumptions on the score estimator beyond control of the score entropy loss.",

        "abstract": "Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for probabilistic modeling, but their performance is often constrained in complex, largescale real-world domains due to the limited expressivity of classical kernels. Quantum computing offers the potential to overcome this limitation by embedding data into exponentially large Hilbert spaces, capturing complex correlations that remain inaccessible to classical computing approaches. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Quantum Gaussian Process (DQGP) method in a multiagent setting to enhance modeling capabilities and scalability. To address the challenging non-Euclidean optimization problem, we develop a Distributed consensus Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (DR-ADMM) algorithm that aggregates local agent models into a global model. We evaluate the efficacy of our method through numerical experiments conducted on a quantum simulator in classical hardware. We use real-world, non-stationary elevation datasets of NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and synthetic datasets generated by Quantum Gaussian Processes. Beyond modeling advantages, our framework highlights potential computational speedups that quantum hardware may provide, particularly in Gaussian processes and distributed optimization.",

        "abstract": "News recommendation plays a critical role in online news platforms by helping users discover relevant content. Cross-domain news recommendation further requires inferring user's underlying information needs from heterogeneous signals that often extend beyond direct news consumption. A key challenge lies in moving beyond surface-level behaviors to capture deeper, reusable user interests while maintaining scalability in large-scale production systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to generate high-quality lists of interest-driven news search queries from cross-domain user signals. We formulate query-list generation as a policy optimization problem and employ GRPO with multiple reward signals. We systematically study two compute dimensions: inference-time sampling and model capacity, and empirically observe consistent improvements with increased compute that exhibit scaling-like behavior. Finally, we perform on-policy distillation to transfer the learned policy from a large, compute-intensive teacher to a compact student model suitable for scalable deployment. Extensive offline experiments, ablation studies and large-scale online A/B tests in a production news recommendation system demonstrate consistent gains in both interest modeling quality and downstream recommendation performance.",

We base our work on the Poseidon PDE foundation model for two-dimensional systems. We develop a method to extend Poseidon from two to three dimensions while keeping the pretraining information. Moreover, we investigate the performance of the model in the presence of sparse initial conditions. Our results make use of four Martian years (approx.~34 GB) of training data and a median compute budget of 13 GPU hours. We find that the combination of pretraining and model extension yields a performance increase of 34.4\\% on a held-out year. This shows that PDEs-FMs can not only approximate solutions to (other) PDEs but also anchor models for real-world problems with complex interactions that lack a sufficient amount of training data or a suitable compute budget.",

        "abstract": "Frontier LLMs are safeguarded against attempts to extract harmful information via adversarial prompts known as \"jailbreaks\". Recently, defenders have developed classifier-based systems that have survived thousands of hours of human red teaming. We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the strongest industry-deployed safeguards. Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength (\"boundary points\"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds. BPJ is difficult to defend against in individual interactions but incurs many flags during optimisation, suggesting that effective defence requires supplementing single-interaction methods with batch-level monitoring.",

Due to the demand that arises from application-related data, there is a need to identify further topological and geometric structures with which these use cases can be made accessible to machine learning. There are various techniques, such as spectral convolution, that form the basic building blocks for some convolutional neural network-like architectures on non-Euclidean data. In this paper, the concept of spectral convolution on orbifolds is introduced. This provides a building block for making learning on orbifold structured data accessible using GDL. The theory discussed is illustrated using an example from music theory.",

This important problem has been studied since the time of Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid. Yet, despite extensive research on actual causation, only few recent studies looked into causation with continuous change. Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test. We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties.",

        "abstract": "Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on RGB imagery, but they do not generalize to thermal images. Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal learning seeks to integrate information from heterogeneous sources, where signals may be shared across modalities, specific to individual modalities, or emerge only through their interaction. While self-supervised multimodal contrastive learning has achieved remarkable progress, most existing methods predominantly capture redundant cross-modal signals, often neglecting modality-specific (unique) and interaction-driven (synergistic) information. Recent extensions broaden this perspective, yet they either fail to explicitly model synergistic interactions or learn different information components in an entangled manner, leading to incomplete representations and potential information leakage. We introduce \\textbf{COrAL}, a principled framework that explicitly and simultaneously preserves redundant, unique, and synergistic information within multimodal representations. COrAL employs a dual-path architecture with orthogonality constraints to disentangle shared and modality-specific features, ensuring a clean separation of information components. To promote synergy modeling, we introduce asymmetric masking with complementary view-specific patterns, compelling the model to infer cross-modal dependencies rather than rely solely on redundant cues. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and diverse MultiBench datasets demonstrate that COrAL consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting low performance variance across runs. These results indicate that explicitly modeling the full spectrum of multimodal information yields more stable, reliable, and comprehensive embeddings.",

Despite their chemical value, they remain underexplored in generative modeling, likely owing to their scarcity in public datasets and the challenges of enforcing topological constraints in standard deep generative models. We introduce MacroGuide: Topological Guidance for Macrocycle Generation, a diffusion guidance mechanism that uses Persistent Homology to steer the sampling of pretrained molecular generative models toward the generation of macrocycles, in both unconditional and conditional (protein pocket) settings. At each denoising step, MacroGuide constructs a Vietoris-Rips complex from atomic positions and promotes ring formation by optimizing persistent homology features. Empirically, applying MacroGuide to pretrained diffusion models increases macrocycle generation rates from 1% to 99%, while matching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance on key quality metrics such as chemical validity, diversity, and PoseBusters checks.",

        "abstract": "Following our previous work (J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2026, 17, 5, 1288-1295), we propose the DMTS-NC approach, a distilled multi-time-step (DMTS) strategy using non conservative (NC) forces to further accelerate atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using foundation neural network models. There, a dual-level reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) formalism couples a target accurate conservative potential to a simplified distilled representation optimized for the production of non-conservative forces. Despite being non-conservative, the distilled architecture is designed to enforce key physical priors, such as equivariance under rotation and cancellation of atomic force components. These choices facilitate the distillation process and therefore improve drastically the robustness of simulation, significantly limiting the \"holes\" in the simpler potential, thus achieving excellent agreement with the forces data. Overall, the DMTS-NC scheme is found to be more stable and efficient than its conservative counterpart with additional speedups reaching 15-30% over DMTS. Requiring no finetuning steps, it is easier to implement and can be pushed to the limit of the systems physical resonances to maintain accuracy while providing maximum efficiency. As for DMTS, DMTS-NC is applicable to any neural network potential.",

        "abstract": "Estimating causal quantities traditionally relies on bespoke estimators tailored to specific assumptions. Recently proposed Causal Foundation Models (CFMs) promise a more unified approach by amortising causal discovery and inference in a single step. However, in their current state, they do not allow for the incorporation of any domain knowledge, which can lead to suboptimal predictions. We bridge this gap by introducing methods to condition CFMs on causal information, such as the causal graph or more readily available ancestral information. When access to complete causal graph information is too strict a requirement, our approach also effectively leverages partial causal information. We systematically evaluate conditioning strategies and find that injecting learnable biases into the attention mechanism is the most effective method to utilise full and partial causal information. Our experiments show that this conditioning allows a general-purpose CFM to match the performance of specialised models trained on specific causal structures. Overall, our approach addresses a central hurdle on the path towards all-in-one causal foundation models: the capability to answer causal queries in a data-driven manner while effectively leveraging any amount of domain expertise.",

While LLMs offer unprecedented scalability and speed, their reliance on web-scale training data raises concerns regarding demographic and behavioral biases that may distort workforce assessment. We present a counterfactual fairness evaluation of LLM-based QA systems across 13 dimensions spanning three categories: Identity, Context, and Behavioral Style. Fairness is quantified using the Counterfactual Flip Rate (CFR), the frequency of binary judgment reversals, and the Mean Absolute Score Difference (MASD), the average shift in coaching or confidence scores across counterfactual pairs. Evaluating 18 LLMs on 3,000 real-world contact center transcripts, we find systematic disparities, with CFR ranging from 5.4% to 13.0% and consistent MASD shifts across confidence, positive, and improvement scores. Larger, more strongly aligned models show lower unfairness, though fairness does not track accuracy. Contextual priming of historical performance induces the most severe degradations (CFR up to 16.4%), while implicit linguistic identity cues remain a persistent bias source. Finally, we analyze the efficacy of fairness-aware prompting, finding that explicit instructions yield only modest improvements in evaluative consistency. Our findings underscore the need for standardized fairness auditing pipelines prior to deploying LLMs in high-stakes workforce evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation.",

        "abstract": "Articulated objects are central to interactive 3D applications, including embodied AI, robotics, and VR/AR, where functional part decomposition and kinematic motion are essential. Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time.",

Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reference-based plan evaluation framework operating in two modes - a metric-wise evaluator spanning seven dimensions (e.g., tool-prompt alignment, query adherence) and a one-shot evaluator; (ii) a data curation methodology that iteratively refines plans via an evaluator->optimizer loop to produce high-quality plan lineages (ordered plan revisions) while reducing manual effort; and (iii) a large-scale study of 14 LLMs across sizes and families for their ability to decompose queries into step-by-step, executable, and tool-assigned plans, evaluated under prompts with and without lineage. Empirically, LLMs struggle on compound queries and on plans exceeding 4 steps (typically 5-15); the best total metric score reaches 84.8% (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), while the strongest one-shot match rate at the \"A+\" tier (Extremely Good, Very Good) is only 49.75% (o3-mini). Plan lineage yields mixed gains overall but benefits several top models and improves step executability for many. Our results highlight persistent gaps in tool-understanding, especially in tool-prompt alignment and tool-usage completeness, and show that shorter, simpler plans are markedly easier. The framework and findings provide a reproducible path for assessing and improving agentic planning with tools for answering data-analysis queries in contact-center settings.",

We work in an online setting where the data distribution can change arbitrarily over time. Existing approaches to this problem aim to minimize the set of objectives over the entire time horizon in a worst-case sense, and in practice they do not necessarily adapt to distribution shifts. Earlier work has aimed to alleviate this problem by incorporating additional objectives that target local guarantees over contiguous subintervals. Empirical evaluation of these proposals is, however, scarce. In this article, we consider an alternative procedure that achieves local adaptivity by replacing one part of the multi-objective learning method with an adaptive online algorithm. Empirical evaluations on datasets from energy forecasting and algorithmic fairness show that our proposed method improves upon existing approaches and achieves unbiased predictions over subgroups, while remaining robust under distribution shift.",

We introduce an architecture that incorporates gradient networks directly into the fundamental machine equations, enabling accurate modeling of the nonlinear and coupled electromagnetic constitutive relationship. By learning the gradient of the magnetic field energy, the model inherently satisfies energy balance (reciprocity conditions). The proposed architecture can universally approximate any physically feasible magnetic behavior and offers several advantages over lookup tables and standard machine learning models: it requires less training data, ensures monotonicity and reliable extrapolation, and produces smooth outputs. These properties further enable robust model inversion and optimal trajectory generation, often needed in control applications. We validate the proposed approach using measured and finite-element method (FEM) datasets from a 5.6-kW permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous reluctance machine. Results demonstrate accurate and physically consistent models, even with limited training data.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.",

        "abstract": "In recent times, there has been considerable interest in fault detection within electrical power systems, garnering attention from both academic researchers and industry professionals. Despite the development of numerous fault detection methods and their adaptations over the past decade, their practical application remains highly challenging. Given the probabilistic nature of fault occurrences and parameters, certain decision-making tasks could be approached from a probabilistic standpoint. Protective systems are tasked with the detection, classification, and localization of faulty voltage and current line magnitudes, culminating in the activation of circuit breakers to isolate the faulty line. An essential aspect of designing effective fault detection systems lies in obtaining reliable data for training and testing, which is often scarce. Leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly the powerful capabilities of pattern classifiers in learning, generalizing, and parallel processing, offers promising avenues for intelligent fault detection. To address this, our paper proposes an anomaly-based approach for fault detection in electrical power systems, employing deep autoencoders. Additionally, we utilize Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) for dimensionality reduction, which, due to its fewer parameters, requires less training time compared to conventional autoencoders. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and accuracy compared to alternative detection approaches by achieving an accuracy of 97.62% and 99.92% on simulated and publicly available datasets.",

        "abstract": "In machine unlearning, $(\\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning is a popular framework that provides formal guarantees on the effectiveness of the removal of a subset of training data, the forget set, from a trained model. For strongly convex objectives, existing first-order methods achieve $(\\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning, but they only use the forget set to calibrate injected noise, never as a direct optimization signal. In contrast, efficient empirical heuristics often exploit the forget samples (e.g., via gradient ascent) but come with no formal unlearning guarantees. We bridge this gap by presenting the Variance-Reduced Unlearning (VRU) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, VRU is the first first-order algorithm that directly includes forget set gradients in its update rule, while provably satisfying ($(\\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning. We establish the convergence of VRU and show that incorporating the forget set yields strictly improved rates, i.e. a better dependence on the achieved error compared to existing first-order $(\\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning methods. Moreover, we prove that, in a low-error regime, VRU asymptotically outperforms any first-order method that ignores the forget set.Experiments corroborate our theory, showing consistent gains over both state-of-the-art certified unlearning methods and over empirical baselines that explicitly leverage the forget set.",

        "abstract": "Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial for deploying pretrained models; yet, many strong methods for quantifying uncertainty require retraining, Monte Carlo sampling, or expensive second-order computations and may alter a frozen backbone's predictions. To address this, we introduce Gaussian Process Activations (GAPA), a post-hoc method that shifts Bayesian modeling from weights to activations. GAPA replaces standard nonlinearities with Gaussian-process activations whose posterior mean exactly matches the original activation, preserving the backbone's point predictions by construction while providing closed-form epistemic variances in activation space. To scale to modern architectures, we use a sparse variational inducing-point approximation over cached training activations, combined with local k-nearest-neighbor subset conditioning, enabling deterministic single-pass uncertainty propagation without sampling, backpropagation, or second-order information. Across regression, classification, image segmentation, and language modeling, GAPA matches or outperforms strong post-hoc baselines in calibration and out-of-distribution detection while remaining efficient at test time.",

Wrivinder combines SfM reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting, semantic grounding, and monocular depth--based metric cues to produce a stable zenith-view rendering that can be directly matched to satellite context for metrically accurate camera geo-localization. To support systematic evaluation of this task, which lacks suitable benchmarks, we also release MC-Sat, a curated dataset linking multi-view ground imagery with geo-registered satellite tiles across diverse outdoor environments. Together, Wrivinder and MC-Sat provide a first comprehensive baseline and testbed for studying geometry-centered cross-view alignment without paired supervision.

        "abstract": "We extend the Prometheus framework for unsupervised phase transition discovery from 2D classical systems to 3D classical and quantum many-body systems, addressing scalability in higher dimensions and generalization to quantum fluctuations. For the 3D Ising model ($L \\leq 32$), the framework detects the critical temperature within 0.01\\% of literature values ($T_c/J = 4.511 \\pm 0.005$) and extracts critical exponents with $\\geq 70\\%$ accuracy ($β= 0.328 \\pm 0.015$, $γ= 1.24 \\pm 0.06$, $ν= 0.632 \\pm 0.025$), correctly identifying the 3D Ising universality class via $χ^2$ comparison ($p = 0.72$) without analytical guidance. For quantum systems, we developed quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architectures using complex-valued wavefunctions and fidelity-based loss. Applied to the transverse field Ising model, we achieve 2\\% accuracy in quantum critical point detection ($h_c/J = 1.00 \\pm 0.02$) and successfully discover ground state magnetization as the order parameter ($r = 0.97$). Notably, for the disordered transverse field Ising model, we detect exotic infinite-randomness criticality characterized by activated dynamical scaling $\\ln ξ\\sim |h - h_c|^{-ψ}$, extracting a tunneling exponent $ψ= 0.48 \\pm 0.08$ consistent with theoretical predictions ($ψ= 0.5$). This demonstrates that unsupervised learning can identify qualitatively different types of critical behavior, not just locate critical points. Our systematic validation across classical thermal transitions ($T = 0$ to $T > 0$) and quantum phase transitions ($T = 0$, varying $h$) establishes that VAE-based discovery generalizes across fundamentally different physical domains, providing robust tools for exploring phase diagrams where analytical solutions are unavailable.",

        "abstract": "To address the global health threat of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are being explored for their potent and promising ability to fight resistant pathogens. While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability.",

        "abstract": "Hypergraph Neural Networks (HyGNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling higher-order relationships among entities. However, their performance often degrades on heterophilic hypergraphs, where nodes connected by the same hyperedge tend to have dissimilar semantic representations or belong to different classes. While several HyGNNs, including our prior work BHyGNN, have been proposed to address heterophily, their reliance on labeled data significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs. Our results validate the effectiveness of leveraging hypergraph duality for self-supervised learning and establish a new paradigm for representation learning on challenging, unlabeled hypergraphs.",

However, this has also led to a significant increase of computational costs and the generation of verbose output, a phenomenon known as overthinking. The tendency to overthinking is often exacerbated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms such as GRPO/DAPO. In this paper, we propose BFS-PO, an RL algorithm which alleviates this problem using a Best-First Search exploration strategy. Specifically, BFS-PO looks for the shortest correct answer using a backtracking mechanism based on maximum entropy nodes. By generating progressively shorter responses during training, BFS-PO learns to produce concise reasoning chains. Using different benchmarks and base LRMs, we show that BFS-PO can simultaneously increase the LRM accuracy and shorten its answers.",

Self-Normalised Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) is a standard tool for variance reduction in OPE, leveraging a multiplicative control variate. Recent advances in off-policy learning suggest that additive control variates (baseline corrections) may offer superior performance, yet theoretical guarantees for evaluation are lacking. This paper provides a definitive answer: we prove that $β^\\star$-IPS, an estimator with an optimal additive baseline, asymptotically dominates SNIPS in Mean Squared Error. By analytically decomposing the variance gap, we show that SNIPS is asymptotically equivalent to using a specific -- but generally sub-optimal -- additive baseline. Our results theoretically justify shifting from self-normalisation to optimal baseline corrections for both ranking and recommendation.",

We analyze the use of pseudo-calibration as a tool to counter this performance loss under a bounded label-conditional covariate shift model. Using tools from domain adaptation, we derive a lower bound on target coverage in terms of the source-domain loss of the classifier and a Wasserstein measure of the shift. Using this result, we provide a method to design pseudo-calibrated sets that inflate the conformal threshold by a slack parameter to keep target coverage above a prescribed level. Finally, we propose a source-tuned pseudo-calibration algorithm that interpolates between hard pseudo-labels and randomized labels as a function of classifier uncertainty. Numerical experiments show that our bounds qualitatively track pseudo-calibration behavior and that the source-tuned scheme mitigates coverage degradation under distribution shift while maintaining nontrivial prediction set sizes.",

We argue instead that robust reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection, itself internalized from high-quality social interaction. Drawing on Vygotskian developmental psychology, we advance three core positions centered on Introspection. First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered. We conclude that optimizing these conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for the next generation of general intelligence.",

        "abstract": "Adjoint-based shape optimization of ship hulls is a powerful tool for addressing high-dimensional design problems in naval architecture, particularly in minimizing the ship resistance. However, its application to vessels that employ complex propulsion systems introduces significant challenges. They arise from the need for transient simulations extending over long periods of time with small time steps and from the reverse temporal propagation of the primal and adjoint solutions. These challenges place considerable demands on the required storage and computing power, which significantly hamper the use of adjoint methods in the industry. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-assisted optimization framework that employs a Conditional Variational Autoencoder-based surrogate model of the propulsion system. The surrogate model replicates the time-averaged flow field induced by a Voith Schneider Propeller and replaces the geometrically and time-resolved propeller with a data-driven approximation. Primal flow verification examples demonstrate that the surrogate model achieves significant computational savings while maintaining the necessary accuracy of the resolved propeller. Optimization studies show that ignoring the propulsion system can yield designs that perform worse than the initial shape. In contrast, the proposed method produces shapes that achieve more than an 8\\% reduction in resistance.",

        "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a de-facto standard technique to elicit reasoning-like responses from large language models (LLMs), allowing them to spell out individual steps before giving a final answer. While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable.",

        "abstract": "Task-specialized models form the backbone of agentic healthcare systems, enabling the agents to answer clinical queries across tasks such as disease diagnosis, localization, and report generation. Yet, for a given task, a single \"best\" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries. Our results demonstrate that ToolSelect consistently outperforms 10 SOTA methods across four different task families.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale deep learning models are well-suited for compression. Methods like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation have been used to achieve massive reductions in the number of model parameters, with marginal performance drops across a variety of architectures and tasks. This raises the central question: \\emph{Why are deep neural networks suited for compression?} In this work, we take up the perspective of algorithmic complexity to explain this behavior. We hypothesize that the parameters of trained models have more structure and, hence, exhibit lower algorithmic complexity compared to the weights at (random) initialization. Furthermore, that model compression methods harness this reduced algorithmic complexity to compress models. Although an unconstrained parameterization of model weights, $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, can represent arbitrary weight assignments, the solutions found during training exhibit repeatability and structure, making them algorithmically simpler than a generic program. To this end, we formalize the Kolmogorov complexity of $\\mathbf{w}$ by $\\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{w})$. We introduce a constrained parameterization $\\widehat{\\mathbf{w}}$, that partitions parameters into blocks of size $s$, and restricts each block to be selected from a set of $k$ reusable motifs, specified by a reuse pattern (or mosaic). The resulting method, $\\textit{Mosaic-of-Motifs}$ (MoMos), yields algorithmically simpler model parameterization compared to unconstrained models. Empirical evidence from multiple experiments shows that the algorithmic complexity of neural networks, measured using approximations to Kolmogorov complexity, can be reduced during training. This results in models that perform comparably with unconstrained models while being algorithmically simpler.",

        "abstract": "Reconciling the tension between inductive learning and deductive reasoning in first-order relational domains is a longstanding challenge in AI. We study the problem of answering queries in a first-order relational probabilistic logic through a joint effort of learning and reasoning, without ever constructing an explicit model. Traditional lifted inference assumes access to a complete model and exploits symmetry to evaluate probabilistic queries; however, learning such models from partial, noisy observations is intractable in general. We reconcile these two challenges through implicit learning to reason and first-order relational probabilistic inference techniques. More specifically, we merge incomplete first-order axioms with independently sampled, partially observed examples into a bounded-degree fragment of the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy in polynomial time. Our algorithm performs two lifts simultaneously: (i) grounding-lift, where renaming-equivalent ground moments share one variable, collapsing the domain of individuals; and (ii) world-lift, where all pseudo-models (partial world assignments) are enforced in parallel, producing a global bound that holds across all worlds consistent with the learned constraints. These innovations yield the first polynomial-time framework that implicitly learns a first-order probabilistic logic and performs lifted inference over both individuals and worlds.",

Optional BLIP captioning enables image-only summaries for stronger multimodal coherence.The pipeline supports features such as adjustable fetch limits, semantic filtering, summary styling, and downloading structured outputs. We expose the system via a Gradio-based API with controllable parameters and preconfigured presets.Evaluation on 500 image-caption pairs with 20:1 contrastive negatives yields a ROC-AUC of 0.9270, an F1-score of 0.6504, and an accuracy of 96.99%, demonstrating strong multimodal alignment.

In contrast, biological networks support rich time-dependent behaviour facilitated by their asymmetry. Here we introduce a general framework, which we term drift-diffusion matching, for training continuous-time RNNs to represent arbitrary stochastic dynamical systems within a low-dimensional latent subspace. Allowing asymmetric connectivity, we show that RNNs can faithfully embed the drift and diffusion of a given stochastic differential equation, including nonlinear and nonequilibrium dynamics such as chaotic attractors. As an application, we construct RNN realisations of stochastic systems that transiently explore various attractors through both input-driven switching and autonomous transitions driven by nonequilibrium currents, which we interpret as models of associative and sequential (episodic) memory. To elucidate how these dynamics are encoded in the network, we introduce decompositions of the RNN based on its asymmetric connectivity and its time-irreversibility. Our results extend attractor neural network theory beyond equilibrium, showing that asymmetric neural populations can implement a broad class of dynamical computations within low-dimensional manifolds, unifying ideas from associative memory, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and neural computation.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce CT-Bench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset comprising two components: a Lesion Image and Metadata Set containing 20,335 lesions from 7,795 CT studies with bounding boxes, descriptions, and size information, and a multitask visual question answering benchmark with 2,850 QA pairs covering lesion localization, description, size estimation, and attribute categorization. Hard negative examples are included to reflect real-world diagnostic challenges. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art multimodal models, including vision-language and medical CLIP variants, by comparing their performance to radiologist assessments, demonstrating the value of CT-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark for lesion analysis. Moreover, fine-tuning models on the Lesion Image and Metadata Set yields significant performance gains across both components, underscoring the clinical utility of CT-Bench.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been a main driver of recent breakthroughs in large reasoning models. Yet it remains a mystery how rewards based solely on final outcomes can help overcome the long-horizon barrier to extended reasoning. To understand this, we develop a theory of the training dynamics of RL for transformers on compositional reasoning tasks. Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs. In contrast, a smooth difficulty spectrum leads to a relay effect: persistent gradient signals on easier problems elevate the model's capabilities to the point where harder ones become tractable, resulting in steady and continuous improvement. Our theory explains how RLVR can improve performance at the edge of competence, and suggests that appropriately designed data mixtures can yield scalable gains. As a technical contribution, our analysis develops and adapts tools from Fourier analysis on finite groups to our setting. We validate the predicted mechanisms empirically via synthetic experiments.",

        "abstract": "As large language models are increasingly trained and fine-tuned, practitioners need methods to identify which training data drive specific behaviors, particularly unintended ones. Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods address this by estimating datapoint influence. Existing approaches like influence functions are both computationally expensive and attribute based on single test examples, which can bias results toward syntactic rather than semantic similarity. To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, relying on sparse rewards makes this process highly sample-inefficient, as models must navigate vast search spaces with minimal feedback. While classic curriculum learning aims to mitigate this by ordering data based on complexity, the right ordering for a specific model is often unclear. To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO. By leveraging the student's performance on seen samples, the teacher continuously adapts to the student's evolving abilities. On OpenMathReasoning dataset, Goldilocks data sampling improves the performance of models trained with standard GRPO under the same compute budget.",

The continuum is treated in terms of quasi-atoms of different size, comprising composite medium. The parameters of interaction potential between the quasi-atoms are optimized to match elastic properties of the composite medium to those of the atomic one. The optimization method coincides conceptually with the online Machine Learning (ML) methods, making it computationally very efficient. Such an approach allows a straightforward application of standard software packages for molecular dynamics (MD), supplemented by the ML-based optimizer. The new method is applied to model systems with a simple, pairwise Lennard-Jones potential, as well with multi-body Tersoff potential, describing covalent bonds. Using LAMMPS software we simulate collision of particles of different size. Comparing simulation results, obtained by the novel method, with full-atomic simulations, we demonstrate its accuracy, validity and overwhelming superiority in computational speed. Furthermore, we compare our method with other hybrid methods, specifically, with the closest one -- AtC (Atomic to Continuum) method. We demonstrate a significant superiority of our approach in computational speed and implementation convenience. Finally, we discuss a possible extension of the method for modeling other phenomena.",

        "abstract": "Temperature scaling is a simple method that allows to control the uncertainty of probabilistic models. It is mostly used in two contexts: improving the calibration of classifiers and tuning the stochasticity of large language models (LLMs). In both cases, temperature scaling is the most popular method for the job. Despite its popularity, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of temperature scaling has remained elusive. We investigate here some of these properties. For classification, we show that increasing the temperature increases the uncertainty in the model in a very general sense (and in particular increases its entropy). However, for LLMs, we challenge the common claim that increasing temperature increases diversity. Furthermore, we introduce two new characterisations of temperature scaling. The first one is geometric: the tempered model is shown to be the information projection of the original model onto the set of models with a given entropy. The second characterisation clarifies the role of temperature scaling as a submodel of more general linear scalers such as matrix scaling and Dirichlet calibration: we show that temperature scaling is the only linear scaler that does not change the hard predictions of the model.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, motivating their use as decision-making policies in complex environments. StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.",

        "abstract": "The traditional limitations of neural networks in reliably generalizing beyond the convex hulls of their training data present a significant problem for computational physics, in which one often wishes to solve PDEs in regimes far beyond anything which can be experimentally or analytically validated. In this paper, we show how it is possible to circumvent these limitations by constructing formally-verified neural network solvers for PDEs, with rigorous convergence, stability, and conservation properties, whose correctness can therefore be guaranteed even in extrapolatory regimes. By using the method of characteristics to predict the analytical properties of PDE solutions a priori (even in regions arbitrarily far from the training domain), we show how it is possible to construct rigorous extrapolatory bounds on the worst-case L^inf errors of shallow neural network approximations. Then, by decomposing PDE solutions into compositions of simpler functions, we show how it is possible to compose these shallow neural networks together to form deep architectures, based on ideas from compositional deep learning, in which the large L^inf errors in the approximations have been suppressed. The resulting framework, called BEACONS (Bounded-Error, Algebraically-COmposable Neural Solvers), comprises both an automatic code-generator for the neural solvers themselves, as well as a bespoke automated theorem-proving system for producing machine-checkable certificates of correctness. We apply the framework to a variety of linear and non-linear PDEs, including the linear advection and inviscid Burgers' equations, as well as the full compressible Euler equations, in both 1D and 2D, and illustrate how BEACONS architectures are able to extrapolate solutions far beyond the training data in a reliable and bounded way. Various advantages of the approach over the classical PINN approach are discussed.",

The proposed method is motivated by the strong sensitivity of commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to the choice of reduced dimension. Rather than selecting a single reduced dimension or averaging results across dimensions, we exploit complementary advantages of multiple reduced dimensions. At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations. We evaluate the proposed framework on the COIL20 and ETH80 image datasets using standard classification protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more stable performance across a wide range of reduced dimensions and achieves consistent improvements to PCA-based baselines in moderate dimensional regimes.",

        "abstract": "Short Term object-interaction Anticipation consists in detecting the location of the next active objects, the noun and verb categories of the interaction, as well as the time to contact from the observation of egocentric video. This ability is fundamental for wearable assistants to understand user goals and provide timely assistance, or to enable human-robot interaction. In this work, we present a method to improve the performance of STA predictions. Our contributions are two-fold: 1 We propose STAformer and STAformer plus plus, two novel attention-based architectures integrating frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, and multiscale feature fusion to support STA predictions from an image-input video pair; 2 We introduce two novel modules to ground STA predictions on human behavior by modeling affordances. First, we integrate an environment affordance model which acts as a persistent memory of interactions that can take place in a given physical scene. We explore how to integrate environment affordances via simple late fusion and with an approach which adaptively learns how to best fuse affordances with end-to-end predictions. Second, we predict interaction hotspots from the observation of hands and object trajectories, increasing confidence in STA predictions localized around the hotspot. Our results show significant improvements on Overall Top-5 mAP, with gain up to +23p.p on Ego4D and +31p.p on a novel set of curated EPIC-Kitchens STA labels. We released the code, annotations, and pre-extracted affordances on Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens to encourage future research in this area.",

        "abstract": "Human eye movements in visual recognition reflect a balance between foveal sampling and peripheral context. Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a \"shortcut regime\" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models have become powerful general-purpose reasoning systems. However, radio-frequency (RF) signals, which underpin wireless systems, are still not natively supported by these models. Existing LLM-based approaches for telecom focus mainly on text and structured data, while conventional RF deep-learning models are built separately for specific signal-processing tasks, highlighting a clear gap between RF perception and high-level reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce RF-GPT, a radio-frequency language model (RFLM) that utilizes the visual encoders of multimodal LLMs to process and understand RF spectrograms. In this framework, complex in-phase/quadrature (IQ) waveforms are mapped to time-frequency spectrograms and then passed to pretrained visual encoders. The resulting representations are injected as RF tokens into a decoder-only LLM, which generates RF-grounded answers, explanations, and structured outputs. To train RF-GPT, we perform supervised instruction fine-tuning of a pretrained multimodal LLM using a fully synthetic RF corpus. Standards-compliant waveform generators produce wideband scenes for six wireless technologies, from which we derive time-frequency spectrograms, exact configuration metadata, and dense captions. A text-only LLM then converts these captions into RF-grounded instruction-answer pairs, yielding roughly 12,000 RF scenes and 0.625 million instruction examples without any manual labeling. Across benchmarks for wideband modulation classification, overlap analysis, wireless-technology recognition, WLAN user counting, and 5G NR information extraction, RF-GPT achieves strong multi-task performance, whereas general-purpose VLMs with no RF grounding largely fail.",

        "abstract": "Effective representations of protein sequences are widely recognized as a cornerstone of machine learning-based protein design. Yet, protein bioengineering poses unique challenges for sequence representation, as experimental datasets typically feature few mutations, which are either sparsely distributed across the entire sequence or densely concentrated within localized regions. This limits the ability of sequence-level representations to extract functionally meaningful signals. In addition, comprehensive comparative studies remain scarce, despite their crucial role in clarifying which representations best encode relevant information and ultimately support superior predictive performance. In this study, we systematically evaluate multiple ProtBERT and ESM2 embedding variants as sequence representations, using the adeno-associated virus capsid as a case study and prototypical example of bioengineering, where functional optimization is targeted through highly localized sequence variation within an otherwise large protein. Our results reveal that, prior to fine-tuning, amino acid-level embeddings outperform sequence-level representations in supervised predictive tasks, whereas the latter tend to be more effective in unsupervised settings. However, optimal performance is only achieved when embeddings are fine-tuned with task-specific labels, with sequence-level representations providing the best performance. Moreover, our findings indicate that the extent of sequence variation required to produce notable shifts in sequence representations exceeds what is typically explored in bioengineering studies, showing the need for fine-tuning in datasets characterized by sparse or highly localized mutations.",

However, these are often sequence-to-sequence tasks: learning to map actions (permutations) to states, which is incompatible with the next-token prediction setting commonly used to train language models. We address this gap by converting permutation composition into code via REPL traces that interleave state-reveals through prints and variable transformations. We show that linear RNNs capable of state-tracking excel also in this setting, while Transformers still fail. Motivated by this representation, we investigate why tracking states in code is generally difficult: actions are not always fully observable. We frame this as tracking the state of a probabilistic finite-state automaton with deterministic state reveals and show that linear RNNs can be worse than non-linear RNNs at tracking states in this setup.",

        "abstract": "Physical commonsense reasoning represents a fundamental capability of human intelligence, enabling individuals to understand their environment, predict future events, and navigate physical spaces. Recent years have witnessed growing interest in reasoning tasks within Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, no prior research has examined the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on non-question-answering (non-QA) physical commonsense reasoning tasks in low-resource languages such as Basque. Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability). These tasks were assessed using multiple multilingual LLMs as well as models pretrained specifically for Italian and Basque. Results indicate that, in terms of verifiability, LLMs exhibit limited physical commonsense capabilities in low-resource languages such as Basque, especially when processing dialectal variants.",

        "abstract": "Tool-using LLM agents increasingly coordinate real workloads by selecting and chaining third-party tools based on text-visible metadata such as tool names, descriptions, and return messages. We show that this convenience creates a supply-chain attack surface: a malicious MCP tool server can be co-registered alongside normal tools and induce overthinking loops, where individually trivial or plausible tool calls compose into cyclic trajectories that inflate end-to-end tokens and latency without any single step looking abnormal. We formalize this as a structural overthinking attack, distinguishable from token-level verbosity, and implement 14 malicious tools across three servers that trigger repetition, forced refinement, and distraction. Across heterogeneous registries and multiple tool-capable models, the attack causes severe resource amplification (up to $142.4\\times$ tokens) and can degrade task outcomes. Finally, we find that decoding-time concision controls do not reliably prevent loop induction, suggesting defenses should reason about tool-call structure rather than tokens alone.",

In this paper, we present \\resource{} the first resource that provides a workflow for extracting datasets including both schema and ground facts, ready for machine learning and reasoning services, along with the resulting curated suite of datasets. The workflow also handles inconsistencies detected when keeping both schema and facts and also leverage reasoning for entailing implicit knowledge. The suite includes newly extracted datasets from KGs with expressive schemas while simultaneously enriching existing datasets with schema information. Each dataset is serialized in OWL making it ready for reasoning services.

        "abstract": "Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization (MSBO) serves as a variant of the traditional Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework applicable to situations involving optimization of an objective black-box function over multiple information sources such as simulations, surrogate models, or real-world experiments. However, traditional MSBO assumes the input variables of the objective function to be independent and identically distributed, limiting its effectiveness in scenarios where causal information is available and interventions can be performed, such as clinical trials or policy-making. In the single-source domain, Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) extends standard BO with the principles of causality, enabling better modeling of variable dependencies. This leads to more accurate optimization, improved decision-making, and more efficient use of low-cost information sources. In this article, we propose a principled integration of the MSBO and CBO methodologies in the multi-source domain, leveraging the strengths of both to enhance optimization efficiency and reduce computational complexity in higher-dimensional problems. We present the theoretical foundations of both Causal and Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization, and demonstrate how their synergy informs our Multi-Source Causal Bayesian Optimization (MSCBO) algorithm. We compare the performance of MSCBO against its foundational counterparts for both synthetic and real-world datasets with varying levels of noise, highlighting the robustness and applicability of MSCBO. Based on our findings, we conclude that integrating MSBO with the causality principles of CBO facilitates dimensionality reduction and lowers operational costs, ultimately improving convergence speed, performance, and scalability.",

        "abstract": "The dynamical stability of the iterates during training plays a key role in determining the minima obtained by optimization algorithms. For example, stable solutions of gradient descent (GD) correspond to flat minima, which have been associated with favorable features. While prior work often relies on linearization to determine stability, it remains unclear whether linearized dynamics faithfully capture the full nonlinear behavior. Recent work has shown that GD may stably oscillate near a linearly unstable minimum and still converge once the step size decays, indicating that linear analysis can be misleading. In this work, we explicitly study the effect of nonlinear terms. Specifically, we derive an exact criterion for stable oscillations of GD near minima in the multivariate setting. Our condition depends on high-order derivatives, generalizing existing results. Extending the analysis to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we show that nonlinear dynamics can diverge in expectation even if a single batch is unstable. This implies that stability can be dictated by a single batch that oscillates unstably, rather than an average effect, as linear analysis suggests. Finally, we prove that if all batches are linearly stable, the nonlinear dynamics of SGD are stable in expectation.",

        "abstract": "Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment a target object described by a natural language expression. Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Designing a speech quality assessment (SQA) system for estimating mean-opinion-score (MOS) of multi-rate speech with varying sampling frequency (16-48 kHz) is a challenging task. The challenge arises due to the limited availability of a MOS-labeled training dataset comprising multi-rate speech samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) models have been widely adopted in SQA to boost performance, a key limitation is that they are pretrained on 16 kHz speech and therefore discard high-frequency information present in higher sampling rates. To address this issue, we propose a spectrogram-augmented SSL method that incorporates high-frequency features (up to 48 kHz sampling rate) through a parallel-branch architecture. We further introduce a two-step training scheme: the model is first pre-trained on a large 48 kHz dataset and then fine-tuned on a smaller multi-rate dataset. Experimental results show that leveraging high-frequency information overlooked by SSL features is crucial for accurate multi-rate SQA, and that the proposed two-step training substantially improves generalization when multi-rate data is limited.",

Their exchanges reflect growing curiosity about AI's criminal applications through legal tools and dedicated criminal tools, but also doubts and anxieties about AI's effectiveness and its effects on their business models and operational security. The study documents attempts to misuse legitimate AI tools and develop bespoke models tailored for illicit purposes. Combining the diffusion of innovation framework with thematic analysis, the paper provides an in-depth view of emerging AI-enabled cybercrime and offers practical insights for law enforcement and policymakers.",

This work investigates hallucinations in small-sized LLMs through a geometric perspective, starting from the hypothesis that when models generate multiple responses to the same prompt, genuine ones exhibit tighter clustering in the embedding space, we prove this hypothesis and, leveraging this geometrical insight, we also show that it is possible to achieve a consistent level of separability. This latter result is used to introduce a label-efficient propagation method that classifies large collections of responses from just 30-50 annotations, achieving F1 scores above 90%. Our findings, framing hallucinations from a geometric perspective in the embedding space, complement traditional knowledge-centric and single-response evaluation paradigms, paving the way for further research.",

Moreover, research has shown that LLMs possess behavioral self-awareness - the ability to describe learned behaviors that were only implicitly demonstrated in training data. Here, we investigate the intersection of these phenomena. We fine-tune GPT-4.1 models sequentially on datasets known to induce and reverse emergent misalignment and evaluate whether the models are self-aware of their behavior transitions without providing in-context examples. Our results show that emergently misaligned models rate themselves as significantly more harmful compared to their base model and realigned counterparts, demonstrating behavioral self-awareness of their own emergent misalignment. Our findings show that behavioral self-awareness tracks actual alignment states of models, indicating that models can be queried for informative signals about their own safety.",

The ML-for-combinatorial-optimization community has focused on learning to \\emph{replace} solvers, yet recent evidence shows that graph neural networks (GNNs) rarely outperform well-tuned classical methods on standard benchmarks. We pursue a different objective: learning to predict \\emph{when} a given instance is hard for greedy allocation, enabling instance-dependent algorithm selection. We design a 20-dimensional structural feature vector and train a lightweight MLP hardness classifier that predicts the greedy optimality gap with mean absolute error 0.033, Pearson correlation 0.937, and binary classification accuracy 94.7\\% across three random seeds. For instances identified as hard -- those exhibiting ``whale-fish'' trap structure where greedy provably fails -- we deploy a heterogeneous GNN specialist that achieves ${\\approx}0\\%$ optimality gap on all six adversarial configurations tested (vs.\\ 3.75--59.24\\% for greedy). A hybrid allocator combining the hardness classifier with GNN and greedy solvers achieves 0.51\\% overall gap on mixed distributions. Our honest evaluation on CATS benchmarks confirms that GNNs do not outperform Gurobi (0.45--0.71 vs.\\ 0.20 gap), motivating the algorithm selection framing. Learning \\emph{when} to deploy expensive solvers is more tractable than learning to replace them.",

        "abstract": "The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.",

These factors significantly limit the applicability of continuous learning in real-world settings, as iterative model updates require significant computational resources and inherently exacerbate forgetting. We present SAILS -- Segment Anything with Incrementally Learned Semantics, a training-free framework for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) that sidesteps these challenges entirely. SAILS leverages foundational models to decouple CISS into two stages: Zero-shot region extraction using Segment Anything Model (SAM), followed by semantic association through prototypes in a fixed feature space. SAILS incorporates selective intra-class clustering, resulting in multiple prototypes per class to better model intra-class variability. Our results demonstrate that, despite requiring no incremental training, SAILS typically surpasses the performance of existing training-based approaches on standard CISS datasets, particularly in long and challenging task sequences where forgetting tends to be most severe. By avoiding parameter updates, SAILS completely eliminates forgetting and maintains consistent, task-invariant performance. Furthermore, SAILS exhibits positive backward transfer, where the introduction of new classes can enhance performance on previous classes.",

        "abstract": "Reasoning-oriented large language models (RLMs) achieve strong gains on tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating explicit intermediate reasoning. However, their impact on machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate several open- and closed-weights RLMs on the WMT24++ benchmark and find that enabling explicit reasoning consistently degrades translation quality across languages and models. Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance. To address this mismatch, we propose a structured reasoning framework tailored to translation, based on multi-step drafting, adequacy refinement, fluency improvement, and selective iterative revision. We curate a synthetic dataset of dynamic structured reasoning traces and post-train a large reasoning model on this data. Experiments show significant improvements over standard translation fine-tuning and injected generic reasoning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning must be task-structured to benefit MT.",

        "abstract": "Current meta-learning methods are constrained to narrow task distributions with fixed feature and label spaces, limiting applicability. Moreover, the current meta-learning literature uses key terms like \"universal\" and \"general-purpose\" inconsistently and lacks precise definitions, hindering comparability. We introduce a theoretical framework for meta-learning which formally defines practical universality and introduces a distinction between algorithm-explicit and algorithm-implicit learning, providing a principled vocabulary for reasoning about universal meta-learning methods. Guided by this framework, we present TAIL, a transformer-based algorithm-implicit meta-learner that functions across tasks with varying domains, modalities, and label configurations. TAIL features three innovations over prior transformer-based meta-learners: random projections for cross-modal feature encoding, random injection label embeddings that extrapolate to larger label spaces, and efficient inline query processing. TAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard few-shot benchmarks while generalizing to unseen domains. Unlike other meta-learning methods, it also generalizes to unseen modalities, solving text classification tasks despite training exclusively on images, handles tasks with up to 20$\\times$ more classes than seen during training, and provides orders-of-magnitude computational savings over prior transformer-based approaches.",

This creates a subtle misalignment: residual connections tie activations to the current token, while supervision targets the next token, potentially propagating mismatched information if the current token is not the most informative for prediction. In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that these strategies alleviate the representation misalignment and yield improvements, providing an efficient and general architectural enhancement for autoregressive Transformers.",

        "abstract": "Deep Learning architectures, and in particular Transformers, are conventionally viewed as a composition of layers. These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models.",

The solution is discretized in the physical domain using finite element methods, while the dependence on a finite-dimensional parameter is approximated separately. We establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the parametric solution and derive rigorous error estimates that explicitly quantify the interplay between spatial discretization and parameter approximation. In low-dimensional parameter spaces, classical interpolation schemes yield algebraic convergence rates based on Sobolev regularity in the parameter variable. In higher-dimensional parameter spaces, we replace classical interpolation by extreme learning machine (ELM) surrogates and obtain error bounds under explicit approximation and stability assumptions. The proposed framework is applied to inverse problems in quantitative photoacoustic tomography, where we derive potential and parameter reconstruction error estimates and demonstrate substantial computational savings compared to standard approaches, without sacrificing accuracy.",

Instead, it updates only a minimal set of parameters using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (e.g. LoRA or VPT), guided by gradients calculated directly from the sparse observations available at inference time. This approach effectively grounds the foundation model's geometric prior in the scene-specific measurements, correcting distortions and misplaced structures. For videos, CAPA introduces sequence-level parameter sharing, jointly adapting all frames to exploit temporal correlations, improve robustness, and enforce multi-frame consistency. CAPA is model-agnostic, compatible with any ViT-based FM, and achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse condition patterns on both indoor and outdoor datasets.

We analyse BFMNs from N = 994 observations spanning high school students, university students, and early-career STEM experts, alongside LLM (GPT-oss) \"digital twins\" prompted to emulate comparable profiles. Focusing also on semantic neighbourhoods (\"frames\") around key target concepts (e.g., STEM subjects or educational actors/places), we quantify frames in terms of valence auras, emotional profiles, network overlap (Jaccard similarity), and concreteness relative to null baselines. Across student groups, science and research are consistently framed positively, while their core quantitative subjects (mathematics and statistics) exhibit more negative and anxiety related auras, amplified in higher math-anxiety subgroups, evidencing a STEM-science cognitive and emotional dissonance. High-anxiety frames are also less concrete than chance, suggesting more abstract and decontextualised representations of threatening quantitative domains. Human networks show greater overlapping between mathematics and anxiety than GPT-oss. The results highlight how BFMNs capture cognitive-affective signatures of mindsets towards the target domains and indicate that LLM-based digital twins approximate cultural attitudes but miss key context-sensitive, experience-based components relevant to replicate human educational anxiety.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced to time series forecasting (TSF) to incorporate contextual knowledge beyond numerical signals. However, existing studies question whether LLMs provide genuine benefits, often reporting comparable performance without LLMs. We show that such conclusions stem from limited evaluation settings and do not hold at scale. We conduct a large-scale study of LLM-based TSF (LLM4TSF) across 8 billion observations, 17 forecasting scenarios, 4 horizons, multiple alignment strategies, and both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our results demonstrate that \\emph{LLM4TS indeed improves forecasting performance}, with especially large gains in cross-domain generalization. Pre-alignment outperforming post-alignment in over 90\\% of tasks. Both pretrained knowledge and model architecture of LLMs contribute and play complementary roles: pretraining is critical under distribution shifts, while architecture excels at modeling complex temporal dynamics. Moreover, under large-scale mixed distributions, a fully intact LLM becomes indispensable, as confirmed by token-level routing analysis and prompt-based improvements. Overall, Our findings overturn prior negative assessments, establish clear conditions under which LLMs are not only useful, and provide practical guidance for effective model design. We release our code at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLM4TSF.",

Our open dataset comprises diverse, manually verified parsing scenarios of varying complexity and enables systematic testing across 22 models and five prompting strategies. We further introduce complementary performance metrics that capture both token-level accuracy and document-level validity, facilitating rigorous comparison of model, size, and prompting effects on parsing reliability. In particular, we show that choosing the right prompting strategy is more important than standard attributes such as model size. This especially ensures structural validity for smaller or less reliable models but increase the number of semantic errors. Our benchmark suite is an step towards future research in the area of LLM applied to parsing or Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) applications.",

        "abstract": "Today's leading AI models engage in sophisticated behaviour when placed in strategic competition. They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act. Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making. Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence. We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes.",

Initial conditions are enforced exactly by construction by fixing the low-order polynomial degrees of freedom, so training focuses solely on matching the differential-equation residual at collocation points. To reduce approximation error without abandoning the low-parameter regime, we introduce a piecewise (\"spline-like\") extension that trains multiple small Horner models on subintervals while enforcing continuity (and first-derivative continuity) at segment boundaries. On illustrative ODE benchmarks and a heat-equation example, Horner networks with tens (or fewer) parameters accurately match the solution and its derivatives and outperform small MLP and sinusoidal-representation baselines under the same training settings, demonstrating a practical accuracy-parameter trade-off for resource-efficient scientific modeling.",

This study investigates how much class information remains accessible under locality-constrained measurements in the presence of noise. The authors formulate binary quantum classification as constrained quantum state discrimination and introduce a locality-restricted distinguishability measure quantifying the maximum bias achievable by observables acting on at most $k$ subsystems. For $n$-qubit systems subject to independent depolarizing noise, the locally accessible signal is governed by a Pauli-weight-dependent contraction mechanism. This motivates a computable predictor, the $k$-local Pauli-accessible amplitude $A_{k}(p)$, which lower bounds the optimal $k$-local classification advantage. Numerical experiments on four-qubit encodings demonstrate quantitative agreement between empirical accuracy and the prediction across noise levels. The research identifies an operational breakdown threshold where $k$-local classifiers become indistinguishable from random guessing despite persistent global distinguishability.",

We interpret this symmetry as a gauge redundancy and introduce gauge-adapted coordinates that separate invariant and scale-imbalance directions. Inspired by gauge fixing in field theory, we introduce a soft orbit-selection (norm-balancing) functional acting only on redundant scale coordinates. We show analytically that it induces dissipative relaxation of imbalance modes to preserve the realized function. In controlled experiments, this orbit-selection penalty expands the stable learning-rate regime and suppresses scale drift without changing expressivity. These results establish a structural link between gauge-orbit geometry and optimization conditioning, providing a concrete connection between gauge-theoretic concepts and machine learning.",

        "abstract": "We systematically investigate the parameter-efficient fine-tuning design space under practical data and compute constraints, and propose D2-LoRA. D2-LoRA achieves 76.4 percent average accuracy across eight question answering and reading comprehension benchmarks using only 5k training samples per task and two epochs, while preserving algebraic mergeability at inference with near-exact numerical equivalence. The method combines signed low-rank residual updates with additive and subtractive components, together with a train-time column-wise projection that keeps each column close to its original norm. After training, the adapter is merged into a single weight matrix, adding zero inference latency. Compared with LoRA, D2-LoRA improves average accuracy by 2.2 percentage points; at matched parameter counts (LoRA rank 2r versus D2-LoRA rank r), the improvement is 1.6 points, indicating gains from architectural design rather than increased parameterization. Compared with DoRA, it matches or exceeds performance on most tasks. Beyond QA and reading comprehension, D2-LoRA improves generative tasks (plus 1.2 ROUGE-L and plus 1.1 percent win rate) and shows 36 percent lower training volatility. The merge preserves numerical fidelity (mean gap about 0.03 percentage points) and recovers about 1.91x evaluation throughput. Training overhead is 19 percent, comparable to DoRA, and decreases with longer input sequences. We provide a geometric analysis explaining how the projection stabilizes training, together with ablation studies isolating the contribution of each design component.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous control of double-Ackermann-steering robots is essential in agricultural applications, where robots must execute precise and complex maneuvers within a limited space. Classical methods, such as the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner, can address this problem, but they rely on parameter tuning, making them highly sensitive to changes in robot configuration or environment and impractical to deploy without constant recalibration. At the same time, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often fail due to unsuitable reward functions for non-holonomic constraints, resulting in sub-optimal policies and poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper presents ManeuverNet, a DRL framework tailored for double-Ackermann systems, combining Soft Actor-Critic with CrossQ. Furthermore, ManeuverNet introduces four specifically designed reward functions to support maneuver learning. Unlike prior work, ManeuverNet does not depend on expert data or handcrafted guidance. We extensively evaluate ManeuverNet against both state-of-the-art DRL baselines and the TEB planner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework substantially improves maneuverability and success rates, achieving more than a 40% gain over DRL baselines. Moreover, ManeuverNet effectively mitigates the strong parameter sensitivity observed in the TEB planner. In real-world trials, ManeuverNet achieved up to a 90% increase in maneuvering trajectory efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.",

        "abstract": "Programmability is increasingly central in emerging quantum network software stacks, yet the node-internal controller-to-hardware interface for quantum repeater devices remains under-specified. We introduce the idea of an instruction-set architecture (ISA) for controller-driven programmability of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center quantum repeater nodes. Each node consists of an optically interfaced electron spin acting as a data qubit and a long-lived nuclear-spin register acting as a control program. We formalize two modes of programmability: (i) deterministic register control, where the nuclear register is initialized in a basis state to select a specific operation on the data qubit; and (ii) coherent register control, where the register is prepared in superposition, enabling coherent combinations of operations beyond classical programmability. Network protocols are expressed as controller-issued instruction vectors, which we illustrate through a compact realization of the BBPSSW purification protocol. We further show that coherent register control enables interferometric diagnostics such as fidelity witnessing and calibration, providing tools unavailable in classical programmability. Finally, we discuss scalability to multi-electron and multi-nuclear spin architectures and connection to Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) and Kraus formulation.",

Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.",

In this article, we explore the assembly of scissor-units, each made of two rigid linear members connected by a pin joint. The assembly has a single degree of freedom, where actuating any single unit results in a shape change of the entire assembly. We derive expressions for the effective curvature of the unit and the trajectory of the mechanism's tip as a function of the geometric variables which we then use as the basis to program two tasks in the mechanism: shape morphing and writing. By phrasing these tasks as optimization problems and utilizing the differentiable simulation framework, we arrive at solutions that are then tested in table-top experiments. Our results show that the geometry of scissor assemblies can be leveraged for automated navigation and inspection in complex domains, in light of the optimization framework. However, we highlight that the challenges associated with rapid programming and error-free implementation in experiments without feedback still remain.",

Current uncertainty estimation methods for AAM vehicles rely on conservative linear models due to limited real-world performance data. This paper presents a novel Kalman Filter-based uncertainty propagation method that models AAM Flight Management System (FMS) architectures through sigmoid-blended measurement noise covariance. Unlike existing approaches with fixed uncertainty thresholds, our method continuously adapts the filter's measurement trust based on progress toward waypoints, enabling FMS correction behavior to emerge naturally. The approach scales proportionally with control inputs and is tunable to match specific aircraft characteristics or route conditions. We validate the method using real ADS-B data from general aviation aircraft divided into training and verification sets. Uncertainty propagation parameters were tuned on the training set, achieving 76% accuracy in predicting arrival times when compared against the verification dataset, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for strategic flight plan validation in AAM operations.",

        "abstract": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how Foundation Model (FM)-based agents interact with external systems by invoking tools. However, to understand a tool's purpose and features, FMs rely on natural-language tool descriptions, making these descriptions a critical component in guiding FMs to select the optimal tool for a given (sub)task and to pass the right arguments to the tool. While defects or smells in these descriptions can misguide FM-based agents, their prevalence and consequences in the MCP ecosystem remain unclear. To address this, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 856 tools spread across 103 MCP servers, assessing their description quality and their impact on agent performance. We identify six components of tool descriptions from the literature, develop a scoring rubric utilizing these components, then formalize tool description smells based on this rubric. By operationalizing this rubric through an FM-based scanner, we find that 97.1% of the analyzed tool descriptions contain at least one smell, with 56% failing to state their purpose clearly. While augmenting these descriptions for all components improves task success rates by a median of 5.85 percentage points and improves partial goal completion by 15.12%, it also increases the number of execution steps by 67.46% and regresses performance in 16.67% of cases. These findings highlight a trade-off between agent performance and cost, as well as the context sensitivity of the performance gain. Furthermore, component ablations show that compact variants of different component combinations often preserve behavioral reliability while reducing unnecessary token overhead, enabling more efficient use of the FM context window and lower execution costs.",

        "abstract": "Traditional learning from demonstration (LfD) generally demands a cumbersome collection of physical demonstrations, which can be time-consuming and challenging to scale. Recent advances show that robots can instead learn from human videos by extracting interaction cues without direct robot involvement. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to generalize demonstrated interactions across different object instances that share similar functionality but vary significantly in geometry. In this work, we propose \\emph{Semantic Anchored Functional Maps} (SemFM), a framework for transferring affordances across objects from a single visual demonstration. Starting from a coarse mesh reconstructed from an image, our method identifies semantically corresponding functional regions between objects, selects mutually exclusive semantic anchors, and propagates these constraints over the surface using a functional map to obtain a dense, semantically consistent correspondence. This enables demonstrated interaction regions to be transferred across geometrically diverse objects in a lightweight and interpretable manner. Experiments on synthetic object categories and real-world robotic manipulation tasks show that our approach enables accurate affordance transfer with modest computational cost, making it well-suited for practical robotic perception-to-action pipelines.",

This paper investigates Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) as a structurally scalable alternative for simultaneous multi-robot path planning. This approach is a robotics-oriented QUBO formulation incorporating BFS-based logical pre-processing (achieving over 95% variable reduction), adaptive penalty design for collision and constraint enforcement, and a time-windowed decomposition strategy that enables execution within current hardware limitations. An experimental evaluation in grid environments with up to four robots demonstrated near-optimal solutions in dense scenarios and favorable scaling behavior compared to sequential classical planning. These results establish a practical and reproducible baseline for future quantum and quantum-inspired multi-robot coordinations.",

Using a Transformer-based model, ROSA jointly predicts the future trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) at roundabouts. Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout. Despite prediction uncertainty, ROSA significantly improves vehicle efficiency and safety, with positive effects even on perceived safety from a VRU perspective.

Unlike prior simulation-based methods that either run quantum algorithms on classical machines or adapt existing databases for quantum simulation, Qute instead (i) compiles an extended form of SQL into gate-efficient quantum circuits, (ii) employs a hybrid optimizer to dynamically select between quantum and classical execution plans, (iii) introduces selective quantum indexing, and (iv) designs fidelity-preserving storage to mitigate current qubit constraints. We also present a three-stage evolution roadmap toward quantum-native database. Finally, by deploying Qute on a real quantum processor (origin_wukong), we show that it outperforms a classical baseline at scale, and we release an open-source prototype at https://github.com/weAIDB/Qute.",

Robotic systems, particularly continuum robots, provide flexible instruments that enable precise tissue resection, potentially improving outcomes. This paper presents a visual perception platform for a continuum robotic system in endoluminal surgery. Our goal is to utilize monocular endoscopic image-based perception algorithms to identify position and orientation of flexible instruments and measure their distances from tissues. We introduce 2D and 3D learning-based perception algorithms and develop a physically-realistic simulator that models flexible instruments dynamics. This simulator generates realistic endoluminal scenes, enabling control of flexible robots and substantial data collection. Using a continuum robot prototype, we conducted module and system-level evaluations. Results show that our algorithms improve control of flexible instruments, reducing manipulation time by over 70% for trajectory-following tasks and enhancing understanding of surgical scenarios, leading to robust endoluminal surgeries.",

        "abstract": "Global solvers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D vision, offering certifiable solutions to nonconvex geometric optimization problems traditionally addressed by local or heuristic methods. This survey presents the first systematic review of global solvers in geometric vision, unifying the field through a comprehensive taxonomy of three core paradigms: Branch-and-Bound (BnB), Convex Relaxation (CR), and Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC). We present their theoretical foundations, algorithmic designs, and practical enhancements for robustness and scalability, examining how each addresses the fundamental nonconvexity of geometric estimation problems. Our analysis spans ten core vision tasks, from Wahba problem to bundle adjustment, revealing the optimality-robustness-scalability trade-offs that govern solver selection. We identify critical future directions: scaling algorithms while maintaining guarantees, integrating data-driven priors with certifiable optimization, establishing standardized benchmarks, and addressing societal implications for safety-critical deployment. By consolidating theoretical foundations, practical advances, and broader impacts, this survey provides a unified perspective and roadmap toward certifiable, trustworthy perception for real-world applications.

        "abstract": "Sparsity is a well-studied technique for compressing deep neural networks (DNNs) without compromising performance. In deep reinforcement learning (DRL), neural networks with up to 5% of their original weights can still be trained with minimal performance loss compared to their dense counterparts. However, most existing methods rely on unstructured fine-grained sparsity, which limits hardware acceleration opportunities due to irregular computation patterns. Structured coarse-grained sparsity enables hardware acceleration, yet typically degrades performance and increases pruning complexity. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study on N:M structured sparsity in RL, which balances compression, performance, and hardware efficiency. Our framework enforces row-wise N:M sparsity throughout training for all networks in off-policy RL (TD3), maintaining compatibility with accelerators that support N:M sparse matrix operations. Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks show that RNM-TD3, our N:M sparse agent, outperforms its dense counterpart at 50%-75% sparsity (e.g., 2:4 and 1:4), achieving up to a 14% increase in performance at 2:4 sparsity on the Ant environment. RNM-TD3 remains competitive even at 87.5% sparsity (1:8), while enabling potential training speedups.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a simulation-driven approach for automating the force-controlled assembly of electrical terminals on DIN-rails, a task traditionally hindered by high programming effort and product variability. The proposed method integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with parameterizable robot skills in a physics-based simulation environment. To realistically model the snap-fit assembly process, we develop and evaluate two types of joining models: analytical models based on beam theory and rigid-body models implemented in the MuJoCo physics engine. These models enable accurate simulation of interaction forces, essential for training DRL agents. The robot skills are structured using the pitasc framework, allowing modular, reusable control strategies. Training is conducted in simulation using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithms. Domain randomization is applied to improve robustness. The trained policies are transferred to a physical UR10e robot system without additional tuning. Experimental results demonstrate high success rates (up to 100%) in both simulation and real-world settings, even under significant positional and rotational deviations. The system generalizes well to new terminal types and positions, significantly reducing manual programming effort. This work highlights the potential of combining simulation-based learning with modular robot skills for flexible, scalable automation in small-batch manufacturing. Future work will explore hybrid learning methods, automated environment parameterization, and further refinement of joining models for design integration.",

        "abstract": "Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) plays an important role in assembly tasks by enabling robots to plan and adjust their motions based on interactive, real-time human instructions. However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous driving in complex traffic requires reasoning under uncertainty. Common approaches rely on prediction-based planning or risk-aware control, but these are typically treated in isolation, limiting their ability to capture the coupled nature of action and inference in interactive settings. This gap becomes especially critical in uncertain scenarios, where simply reacting to predictions can lead to unsafe maneuvers or overly conservative behavior. Our central insight is that safe interaction requires not only estimating human behavior but also shaping it when ambiguity poses risks. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical belief model that structures human behavior across coarse discrete intents and fine motion modes, updated via Bayesian inference for interpretable multi-resolution reasoning. On top of this, we develop an active probing strategy that identifies when multimodal ambiguity in human predictions may compromise safety and plans disambiguating actions that both reveal intent and gently steer human decisions toward safer outcomes. Finally, a runtime risk-evaluation layer based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ensures that all probing actions remain within human risk tolerance during influence. Our simulations in lane-merging and unsignaled intersection scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves higher success rates and shorter completion times compared to existing methods. These results highlight the benefit of coupling belief inference, probing, and risk monitoring, yielding a principled and interpretable framework for planning under uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "Robotic knot-tying represents a fundamental challenge in robotics due to the complex interactions between deformable objects and strict topological constraints. We present TWISTED-RL, a framework that improves upon the previous state-of-the-art in demonstration-free knot-tying (TWISTED), which smartly decomposed a single knot-tying problem into manageable subproblems, each addressed by a specialized agent. Our approach replaces TWISTED's single-step inverse model that was learned via supervised learning with a multi-step Reinforcement Learning policy conditioned on abstract topological actions rather than goal states. This change allows more delicate topological state transitions while avoiding costly and ineffective data collection protocols, thus enabling better generalization across diverse knot configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that TWISTED-RL manages to solve previously unattainable knots of higher complexity, including commonly used knots such as the Figure-8 and the Overhand. Furthermore, the increase in success rates and drop in planning time establishes TWISTED-RL as the new state-of-the-art in robotic knot-tying without human demonstrations.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), multi-round workflows, such as autonomous agents and iterative retrieval, have become increasingly prevalent. However, this raises hurdles for serving LLMs under prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation, a widely adopted paradigm that separates the compute-bound prefill phase and memory-bound decode phase onto individual resources. Specifically, existing systems overlook the interleaved prefill-decode workload pattern in multi-round inference, leading to sub-optimal handling of the incremental prefill workloads and model deployment for the two phases. In this work, we present AMPD, a brand new disaggregated serving framework for multi-round LLM inference. The core of AMPD is to coordinate the prefill workloads based on real-time workloads by adaptively determining where to carry out these workloads and how they are scheduled, in order to maximize service level objective (SLO) attainment. In addition, we tailor a planning algorithm for our scenario, facilitating the deduction of optimal resource allocation and parallel strategies for the two phases. Empirical results demonstrate that AMPD substantially improves SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

However, autonomous stair climbing across different indoor staircases remains a major challenge for robot dogs to complete building construction tasks. In this project, we employed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize a robot's performance on U-shaped stairs. The training robot-dog modality, Unitree Go2, was first trained to climb stairs on Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain, and then to climb a U-shaped indoor staircase using the learned policies. This project explores end-to-end RL methods that enable robot dogs to autonomously climb stairs. The results showed (1) the successful goal reached for robot dogs climbing U-shaped stairs with a stall penalty, and (2) the transferability from the policy trained on U-shaped stairs to deployment on straight, L-shaped, and spiral stair terrains, and transferability from other stair models to deployment on U-shaped terrain.",

The goal is to integrate the strengths of LLMs and VLMs with computational tools to automatically analyze and solve problems related to robotic manipulators. Our developed framework accepts both textual and visual inputs and can automatically perform forward and inverse kinematics, compute velocities and accelerations of key points, generate 3D simulations of the robot, and ultimately execute motion control within the simulated environment, all according to the user's query. To evaluate the framework, three benchmark tests were designed, each consisting of ten questions. In the first benchmark test, the framework was evaluated while connected to GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3.2, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5, as well as their corresponding raw models. The objective was to extract the forward kinematics of robots directly from textual descriptions. The results showed that the framework integrated with GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 0.97 in computing the final solution, whereas the raw model alone attained an accuracy of only 0.30 for the same task. Similarly, for the other two models, the framework consistently outperformed the corresponding raw models in terms of accuracy. The second benchmark test was identical to the first, except that the input was provided in visual form. In this test, the GPT-4o LLM was used alongside the Gemini 2.5 Pro VLM. The results showed that the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.93 in obtaining the final answer, which is approximately 20% higher than that of the corresponding raw model. The third benchmark test encompassed a range of robotic tasks, including simulation, control, velocity and acceleration computation, as well as inverse kinematics and Jacobian calculation, for which the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.97.",

        "abstract": "Contact-rich manipulation tasks in unstructured environments pose significant robustness challenges for robot learning, where unexpected collisions can cause damage and hinder policy acquisition. Existing soft end-effectors face fundamental limitations: they either provide a limited deformation range, lack directional stiffness control, or require complex actuation systems that compromise practicality. This study introduces CLAW (Compliant Leaf-spring Anisotropic soft Wrist), a novel soft wrist mechanism that addresses these limitations through a simple yet effective design using two orthogonal leaf springs and rotary joints with a locking mechanism. CLAW provides large 6-degree-of-freedom deformation (40mm lateral, 20mm vertical), anisotropic stiffness that is tunable across three distinct modes, while maintaining lightweight construction (330g) at low cost ($550). Experimental evaluations using imitation learning demonstrate that CLAW achieves 76% success rate in benchmark peg-insertion tasks, outperforming both the Fin Ray gripper (43%) and rigid gripper alternatives (36%). CLAW successfully handles diverse contact-rich scenarios, including precision assembly with tight tolerances and delicate object manipulation, demonstrating its potential to enable robust robot learning in contact-rich domains.

Despite this, most VIO evaluations emphasize nominal sensor behavior, leaving the effects of sustained sensor degradation under operational conditions insufficiently understood. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of VIO behavior under degraded sensing, examining faults affecting visual and inertial modalities across a range of operating regimes. Through systematic fault injection and quantitative evaluation, we observe a pronounced asymmetry in fault impact where degradations affecting visual sensing typically lead to bounded pose errors on the order of centimeters, whereas degradations affecting inertial sensing can induce substantially larger trajectory deviations, in some cases reaching hundreds to thousands of meters. These observations motivate greater emphasis on inertial reliability in the evaluation and design of XR systems for real-life industrial settings.",

        "abstract": "Neural network (NN) accelerators with multi-chip-module (MCM) architectures enable integration of massive computation capability; however, they face challenges of computing resource underutilization and off-chip communication overheads. Traditional parallelization schemes for NN inference on MCM architectures, such as intra-layer parallelism and inter-layer pipelining, show incompetency in breaking through both challenges, limiting the scalability of MCM architectures. We observed that existing works typically deploy layers separately rather than considering them jointly. This underexploited dimension leads to compromises between system computation and communication, thus hindering optimal utilization, especially as hardware/software scale. To address this limitation, we propose Scope, a merged pipeline framework incorporating this overlooked multi-layer dimension, thereby achieving improved throughput and scalability by relaxing tradeoffs between computation, communication and memory costs. This new dimension, however, adds to the complexity of design space exploration (DSE). To tackle this, we develop a series of search algorithms that achieves exponential-to-linear complexity reduction, while identifying solutions that rank in the top 0.05% of performance. Experiments show that Scope achieves up to 1.73x throughput improvement while maintaining similar energy consumption for ResNet-152 inference compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has become a promising answer to facilitating privacy-preserving collaborative learning in distributed IoT devices. However, device heterogeneity is a key challenge because IoT networks include devices with very different computational powers, memory availability, and network environments. To this end, we introduce ASA (Adaptive Smart Agent). This new framework clusters devices adaptively based on real-time resource profiles and adapts customized models suited to every cluster's capability. ASA capitalizes on an intelligent agent layer that examines CPU power, available memory, and network environment to categorize devices into three levels: high-performance, mid-tier, and low-capability. Each level is provided with a model tuned to its computational power to ensure inclusive engagement across the network. Experimental evaluation on two benchmark datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10, proves that ASA decreases communication burden by 43% to 50%, improves resource utilization by 43%, and achieves final model accuracies of 98.89% on MNIST and 85.30% on CIFAR-10. These results highlight ASA's efficacy in enhancing efficiency, scalability, and fairness in heterogeneous FL environments, rendering it a suitable answer for real-world IoT apps.",

The key findings of this study indicate that Q-learning can effectively predict the appropriate allocation of resources by learning from past experiences and making informed decisions. Through continuous training and updating of the Q-learning agent, the system can adapt to changing conditions and make resource allocation decisions based on real-time information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing resource allocation. The Q-learning agent predicts the optimal values for memory, bandwidth, and processor. These predictions not only minimize resource consumption but also meet the performance requirements of the fog system.

        "abstract": "Bitcoin's design promises resilience through decentralization, yet physical infrastructure creates hidden dependencies. We present the first longitudinal study of Bitcoin's resilience to infrastructure failures using 11 years of P2P network data (2014-2025), 658 submarine cables, and 68 verified cable fault events. Using a Buldyrev-style cascade model with a country-level physical layer (225 countries, 354 submarine cable edges, 325 land border edges), we find that Bitcoin's clearnet percolation threshold $p_c \\approx 0.72$-$0.92$ for random cable failures, declining 22% from $p_c \\approx 0.92$ (2014-2017) to a minimum of $p_c = 0.72$ in 2021 during peak mining concentration. Targeted attacks reduce $p_c$ to 0.05-0.20. To address the 64% of nodes using Tor with unobservable locations, we develop a 4-layer multiplex model incorporating Tor relay infrastructure. Tor relay bandwidth concentrates in well-connected European countries, increasing resilience by $Δp_c \\approx +0.02$-$+0.10$ rather than introducing fragility. Empirical validation shows 87% of cable faults caused less than 5% node impact. We contribute: (1) a multiplex percolation framework for overlay-underlay coupling with a 4-layer Tor relay model; (2) the first empirical measurement of Bitcoin's physical-layer resilience over a decade; and (3) evidence that Tor adoption amplifies resilience with distributional bounds under partial observability.",

Unlike prior imitation learning-based approaches that rely on human demonstrations and are often brittle to disturbances, AdaptManip aims to train a robust loco-manipulation policy via reinforcement learning without human demonstrations or teleoperation data. The proposed framework consists of three coupled components: (1) a recurrent object state estimator that tracks the manipulated object in real time under limited field-of-view and occlusions; (2) a whole-body base policy for robust locomotion with residual manipulation control for stable object lifting and delivery; and (3) a LiDAR-based robot global position estimator that provides drift-robust localization. All components are trained in simulation using reinforcement learning and deployed on real hardware in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results show that AdaptManip significantly outperforms baseline methods, including imitation learning-based approaches, in adaptability and overall success rate, while accurate object state estimation improves manipulation performance even under occlusion. We further demonstrate fully autonomous real-world navigation, object lifting, and delivery on a humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "Edge-cloud convergence is reshaping service provisioning across 5G/6G and computing power networks (CPNs). Service function chaining (SFC) requires continuously placing and scheduling virtual network functions (VNFs) chains under compute/bandwidth and end-to-end QoS constraints. Most SFC optimizers assume static or stationary networks, and degrade under long-term topology/resource changes (failures, upgrades, expansions) that induce non-stationary graph drifts. We propose LiSFC, a Lipschitz lifelong planner that transfers MCTS statistics across drifting network configurations using an MDP-distance bound. More precisely, we formulate the problem as a sequence of MDPs indexed by the underlying network graph and constraints, and we define a \\emph{graph drift} metric that upper-bounds the LiZero MDP distance. This allows LiSFC to import theoretical guarantees on bias and sample efficiency from the LiZero framework while being tailored to cloud-network convergence. We then design \\emph{LiSFC-Search}, an SFC-aware unified MCTS (UMCTS) procedure that uses transferable adaptive UCT (aUCT) bonuses to reuse search statistics from prior CPN configurations. Preliminary results on synthetic CPN topologies and SFC workloads show that LiSFC consistently reduces SFC blocking probability and improves tail delay compared to non-transfer MCTS and purely learning-based baselines, highlighting its potential as an AI/ML building block for cloud-network convergence.",

In our approach, we propose to capture a system's (stochastic) behavior using interval Hidden Markov Models (iHMMs). The monitor then uses this learned iHMM to derive risk estimates for potential safety violations. The paper makes three key contributions: (1) it provides a formalization of the problem of learning robust runtime monitors, (2) introduces a novel framework that uses conformance-testing-based refinement for learning robust iHMMs with convergence guarantees, and (3) presents an efficient monitoring algorithm for computing risk estimates over iHMMs. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of monitors learned using our approach, particularly when compared to model-free monitoring approaches that rely solely on collected data without access to a system model.",

        "abstract": "Models of High-level Computation (MHCs) provide effective means to describe complex real-world computing systems because they offer formal foundations for the specification of interacting computing devices, as opposed to describing individual ones, which has been the focus of classical models such as Turing machines or the lambda calculus. Despite numerous proposals over the past half century, there is still no canonical MHC akin to Turing machines for (compositionally) reasoning about computation in the large. One of the major drawbacks of current MHCs is that they extensively neglect control flow, a well-know semantic property that defines computation order. Only a few MHCs treat control explicitly at the expense of assuming that data follows control. Mixing such dimensions within the same framework leads to inefficient methods for formal analysis and verification. To address this, the computon model has recently emerged as a category-theoretic MHC that separates data and control and makes control explicit by supporting composition operators characterised as finite colimit constructions. Such constructions allow the formation of sequential, parallel, branching and iterative computing devices. Unfortunately, the computon model is still a generic reference rather than a concrete realisation. In this paper, we provide a variation of it to enable functional computing devices, introduce a new branching operator, discuss how to define synchronous parallelising out of sequencing and asynchronous parallelising, describe concrete operational semantics for computon execution and provide the first implementation of the model. The implementation yields an open-source programming environment that realises the underlying categorical semantics. This tool is publicly available and ready to build complex computing devices that are structurally correct by construction.",

        "abstract": "Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) enables user-controlled, cryptographically verifiable credentials. As EU regulations mandate EUDI Wallet acceptance by 2027, SSI adoption becomes a compliance necessity. However, each SSI Verifier exposes different APIs with distinct request parameters, response formats, and claim structures, requiring custom wrappers and dedicated infrastructure, contrasting with OpenID Connect (OIDC) where standardized protocols enable seamless integration. interID is an ecosystem-agnostic platform unifying credential verification across Hyperledger Aries/Indy, EBSI, and EUDI ecosystems. We extend interID with an OIDC bridge providing Verifier-as-a-Service, enabling SSI verification through standard OIDC flows. Organizations receive ID Tokens with verified credential attributes without implementing Verifier-specific logic or deploying infrastructure. The multi-tenant architecture leverages Keycloak with strict tenant isolation. Key innovations include PKCE support, scope-to-proof-template mappings translating OIDC scopes into ecosystem-specific verification requests, and a security analysis identifying novel attack surfaces at the intersection of OIDC, SSI, and multi-tenant architectures, threats covered by neither RFC 6819 nor existing SSI analyses alone. Our evaluation demonstrates security equivalence to production identity providers through threat modeling identifying 11 attack vectors, including seven beyond RFC 6819's scope. Integration analysis shows organizations can adopt SSI authentication with comparable effort to adding traditional federated providers. By combining familiar OIDC patterns with SaaS deployment, our work lowers integration and operational barriers, enabling regulatory compliance through configuration rather than custom development.",

        "abstract": "For a fixed regular language $L$, the enumeration of $L$-infixes is the following task: we are given an input word $w = a_1 \\cdots a_n$ and we must enumerate the infixes of $w$ that belong to $L$, i.e., the pairs $i \\leq j$ such that $a_i \\cdots a_j \\in L$. We are interested in dynamic enumeration of $L$-infixes, where we must additionally support letter substitution updates on $w$ (e.g., \"replace the $i$-th letter of $w$ by a letter $a$\"). Each update changes the set of infixes to enumerate, and resets the enumeration state. We study for which regular languages $L$ we can perform dynamic enumeration of $L$-infixes in constant delay (i.e., the next infix is always produced in constant time) and constant additional memory throughout the enumeration, while supporting each update in constant time. We show that, for languages $L$ with a neutral letter, if the language $L$ belongs to the class ZG and is extensible (i.e., if $u \\in L$ and $u$ is a factor of $v$ then $v \\in L$), then dynamic enumeration of $L$-infixes can be achieved with a simple algorithm that ensures constant-time updates and constant delay, but not constant additional memory. Our main contribution is then to show an algorithm that additionally uses only constant additional memory, and applies to a more general class of semi-extensible ZG languages for which we give several equivalent characterizations. We further discuss whether our results can be generalized to larger language classes and show some (conditional) lower bounds.",

The crossing gap (max(i'-i, j'-j) for two crossing push-pop arcs) is the natural candidate. We refute this: we exhibit CFLs whose intersection is CFL despite unbounded-gap crossings. The governing quantity is the inner segment measure: for crossing arcs inducing a decomposition w = P1 P2 P3 P4, it is max(|P2|,|P3|), the length of the longer inner segment between interleaved crossing endpoints. We prove a dichotomy for this measure: bounded inner segments imply context-freeness via a finite buffer construction; growing inner segments with pump-sensitive linkages imply non-context-freeness. The inner segment concept applies to all CFL intersections; the strictness of the resulting characterization depends on the language class. For block-counting CFLs (languages requiring equality among designated pairs of block lengths), the dichotomy is complete: the intersection is CFL if and only if the combined arcs are jointly well-nested. For general CFLs, the CFL direction is unconditional; the non-CFL direction requires pump-sensitive linkages whose necessity is the main open problem, reducing the general CFL intersection problem to a specific property of pump-sensitive decompositions.",

We propose a general framework for optimal synthesis of such programs in a given domain specific language (DSL), with provable optimality guarantees. Our framework enumerates programs in a general search graph, where nodes represent subsets of concrete programs. To improve scalability, it uses A* search in conjunction with a search heuristic based on abstract interpretation; intuitively, this heuristic establishes upper bounds on the value of subtrees in the search graph, enabling the synthesizer to identify and prune subtrees that are provably suboptimal. In addition, we propose a natural strategy for constructing abstract transformers for monotonic semantics, which is a common property for components in DSLs for data classification. Finally, we implement our approach in the context of two such existing DSLs, demonstrating that our algorithm is more scalable than existing optimal synthesizers.",

We identify eight configuration mechanisms and, in an empirical study of 2,926 GitHub repositories, examine whether and how they are adopted. We then explore Context Files, Skills, and Subagents, that is, three mechanisms available across tools, in more detail. Our findings reveal three trends. First, Context Files dominate the configuration landscape and are often the sole mechanism in a repository, with AGENTS$.$md emerging as an interoperable standard across tools. Second, advanced mechanisms such as Skills and Subagents are only shallowly adopted: most repositories define only one or two artifacts, and Skills predominantly rely on static instructions rather than executable workflows. Third, distinct configuration cultures are forming around different tools, with Claude Code users employing the broadest range of mechanisms. These findings establish an empirical baseline for longitudinal and experimental research on how configuration strategies evolve and affect agent performance as agentic AI coding tools mature.",

        "abstract": "As the capabilities of large language models continue to advance, so does their potential for misuse. While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs.",

In this paper, we extend RI for constrained equations to existentially quantified equations in logically constrained rewriting. To this end, we first extend constrained equations by introducing existential quantification to the equation part of constrained equations. Then, in applying a constrained rewrite rule to such extended constrained equations, we introduce existential quantification to extra variables of the applied rule. Finally, using the extended application of constrained rewrite rules, we extend RI for constrained equations to existentially quantified equations.",

        "abstract": "Lifting Boolean-reasoning techniques to the SMT level most often requires producing theory lemmas that rule out theory-inconsistent truth assignments. With standard SMT solving, it is common to \"lazily\" generate such lemmas on demand during the search; with some harder SMT-level tasks -- such as unsat-core extraction, MaxSMT, T-OBDD or T-SDD compilation -- it may be beneficial or even necessary to \"eagerly\" pre-compute all the needed theory lemmas upfront. Whereas in principle \"classic\" eager SMT encodings could do the job, they are specific for very few and easy theories, they do not comply with theory combination, and may produce lots of unnecessary lemmas. In this paper, we present theory-agnostic methods for enumerating complete sets of theory lemmas tailored to a given formula. Starting from AllSMT as a baseline approach, we propose improved lemma-enumeration techniques, including divide&conquer, projected enumeration, and theory-driven partitioning, which are highly parallelizable and which may drastically improve scalability. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that these techniques significantly enhance efficiency and enable the method to scale to substantially more complex instances.",

A PR can be supported by a description, whose role has not yet been systematically investigated. To fill in this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study of PR descriptions. We conducted a grey literature review of guidelines on writing PR descriptions and derived a taxonomy of eight recommended elements. Using this taxonomy, we analyzed 80K GitHub PRs across 156 projects and five programming languages to assess associations between these elements and code review outcomes (e.g., merge decision, latency, first response time, review comments, and review iteration cycles). To complement these results, we surveyed 64 developers about the perceived importance of each element. Finally, we analyzed which submission-time factors predict whether PRs include a description and which elements they contain. We found that developers view PR descriptions as important, but their elements matter differently: purpose and code explanations are valued by developers for preserving the rationale and history of changes, while stating the desired feedback type best predicts change acceptance and reviewer engagement. PR descriptions are also more common in mature projects and complex changes, suggesting they are written when most useful rather than as a formality.",

        "abstract": "The sustainability of Security Operations Centers depends on their people, yet 71% of practitioners report burnout and 24% plan to exit cybersecurity entirely. Flow theory suggests that when job demands misalign with practitioner capabilities, work becomes overwhelming or tedious rather than engaging. Achieving challenge-skill balance begins at hiring: if job descriptions inaccurately portray requirements, organizations risk recruiting underskilled practitioners who face anxiety or overskilled ones who experience boredom. Yet we lack empirical understanding of what current SOC job descriptions actually specify. We analyzed 106 public SOC job postings from November to December 2024 across 35 organizations in 11 countries, covering Analysts (n=17), Incident Responders (n=38), Threat Hunters (n=39), and SOC Managers (n=12). Using Inductive Content Analysis, we coded certifications, technical skills, soft skills, tasks, and experience requirements. Three patterns emerged: (1) Communication skills dominate (50.9% of postings), exceeding SIEM tools (18.9%) or programming (30.2%), suggesting organizations prioritize collaboration over technical capabilities. (2) Certification expectations vary widely: CISSP leads (22.6%), but 43 distinct credentials appear with no universal standard. (3) Technical requirements show consensus: Python dominates programming (27.4%), Splunk leads SIEM platforms (14.2%), and ISO 27001 (13.2%) and NIST (10.4%) are most cited standards. These findings enable organizations to audit job descriptions against empirical baselines, help practitioners identify valued certifications and skills, and allow researchers to validate whether stated requirements align with actual demands. This establishes the foundation for flow-aligned interview protocols and investigation of how AI reshapes requirements. Dataset and codebook: https://git.tu-berlin.de/wosoc-2026/soc-jd-analysis.",

        "abstract": "Automated Code Revision (ACR) tools aim to reduce manual effort by automatically generating code revisions based on reviewer feedback. While ACR tools have shown promising performance on historical data, their real-world utility depends on their ability to handle similar code variants expressing the same issue - a property we define as consistency. However, the probabilistic nature of ACR tools often compromises consistency, which may lead to divergent revisions even for semantically equivalent code variants. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which ACR tools maintain consistency when presented with semantically equivalent code variants. To do so, we first designed nine types of semantics-preserving perturbations (SPP) and applied them to 2032 Java methods from real-world GitHub projects, generating over 10K perturbed variants for evaluation. Then we used these perturbations to evaluate the consistency of five state-of-the-art transformer-based ACR tools. We found that the ACR tools' ability to generate correct revisions can drop by up to 45.3%, when presented with semantically equivalent code. The closer the perturbation is to this targeted region, the more likely an ACR tool is to fail to generate the correct revision. We explored potential mitigation strategies that modify the input representation, but found that these attention-guiding heuristics yielded only marginal improvements, thus leaving the solution to this problem as an open research question.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an automated method for classifying source code changes during the software development process based on clustering of change metrics. The method consists of two steps: clustering of metric vectors computed for each code change, followed by expert mapping of the resulting clusters to predefined change classes. The distribution of changes into clusters is performed automatically, while the mapping of clusters to classes is carried out by an expert. Automation of the distribution step substantially reduces the time required for code change review. The k-means algorithm with a cosine similarity measure between metric vectors is used for clustering. Eleven source code metrics are employed, covering lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, file counts, interface changes, and structural changes. The method was validated on five software systems, including two open-source projects (Subversion and NHibernate), and demonstrated classification purity of P_C = 0.75 +/- 0.05 and entropy of E_C = 0.37 +/- 0.06 at a significance level of 0.05.",

        "abstract": "CI/CD practices play a significant role during collaborative software development by automating time-consuming and repetitive tasks such as testing, building, quality checking, dependency and security management. GitHub Actions, the CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub, allows repository maintainers to automate development workflows. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of GitHub Actions workflow changes over time. Through a preliminary qualitative analysis of 439 modified workflow files we identified seven types of conceptual changes to workflows. Next, we performed a quantitative analysis over 49K+ GitHub repositories totaling 267K+ workflow change histories and 3.4M+ workflow file versions from November 2019 to August 2025. This analysis revealed that repositories contain a median of three workflow files, and 7.3% of all workflow files are being changed every week. The changes made to workflows tend to be small, with about three-quarters containing only a single change. The large majority of the observed changes have to do with task configuration and task specification in workflow jobs. We did not find any conclusive evidence of the effect of LLM coding tools or other major technological changes on workflow creation and workflow maintenance frequency. Our findings highlight the need for improved tooling to support fine-grained maintenance tasks, such as a broader adoption of dependency management and AI-based support for ensuring and sustaining workflow security and quality.",

The central theme in Polar comes with handling algebraic recurrences that precisely capture the loop semantics. To this end, our work implements a variety of techniques to compute exact closed-forms of recurrences over higher-order moments of variables, infer invariants, and derive loop sensitivities with respect to unknown parameters. Polar can analyze probabilistic loops containing if-statements, polynomial arithmetic, and common probability distributions. By translating loop analysis into linear recurrence solving, Polar uses the derived closed-forms of recurrences to compute the strongest polynomial invariant or to infer parameter sensitivity. Polar is both sound and complete within well-defined programming model restrictions. Lifting any of these restrictions results in significant hardness limits of computation. To overcome computational burdens for the sake of efficiency, Polar also provides incomplete but sound techniques to compute moments of combinations of variables.",

        "abstract": "Advances in quantum computing increasingly threaten the security and privacy of data protected by current cryptosystems, particularly those relying on public-key cryptography. In response, the international cybersecurity community has prioritized the implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), a new cryptographic standard designed to resist quantum attacks while operating on classical computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already standardized several PQC algorithms and plans to deprecate classical asymmetric schemes, such as RSA and ECDSA, by 2035. Despite this urgency, PQC adoption remains slow, often due to limited developer expertise. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are intended to bridge this gap, yet prior research on classical security APIs demonstrates that poor usability of cryptographic APIs can lead developers to introduce vulnerabilities during implementation of the applications, a risk amplified by the novelty and complexity of PQC. To date, the usability of PQC APIs has not been systematically studied. This research presents an empirical evaluation of the usability of the PQC APIs, observing how developers interact with APIs and documentation during software development tasks. The study identifies cognitive factors that influence the developer's performance when working with PQC primitives with minimal onboarding. The findings highlight opportunities across the PQC ecosystem to improve developer-facing guidance, terminology alignment, and workflow examples to better support non-specialists.",

        "abstract": "Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) enables untrusted parties to jointly compute a function without revealing their inputs. Its application to machine learning (ML) has gained significant attention, particularly for secure inference services deployed across multiple cloud virtual machines (VMs), where each VM acts as an MPC party. Model providers secret-share model weights, and users secret-share inputs, ensuring that each server operates only on random shares. While MPC provides strong cryptographic guarantees, it incurs substantial computational and communication overhead. Deep neural networks rely heavily on convolutional and fully connected layers, which require costly matrix multiplications in MPC. To reduce this cost, we propose leveraging low-rank decomposition (LRD) for linear layers, replacing one large matrix multiplication with two smaller ones. Each matrix multiplication in MPC incurs a round of communication, meaning decomposing one matrix multiplication into two leads to an additional communication round. Second, the added matrix multiplication requires an additional truncation step to maintain numerical precision. Since truncation itself requires communication and computation, these overheads can offset the gains from decomposition. To address this, we introduce two complementary optimizations: truncation skipping and efficient linear layer concatenation. Truncation skipping removes the extra truncation induced by LRD, while linear layer concatenation pipelines operations to hide the additional communication round. Together, these techniques mitigate the main overheads of LRD in MPC and improve overall efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across MPC protocols. Experiments show up to 25% speedup in n-PC and 33% in 3-PC protocols over full-rank baselines, along with up to 52% GPU energy savings and 88% reduction in offline-phase latency.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a widely used framework for reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific tasks by retrieving relevant documents from a database to support accurate responses. However, when the database contains sensitive corpora, such as medical records or legal documents, RAG poses serious privacy risks by potentially exposing private information through its outputs. Prior work has demonstrated that one can practically craft adversarial prompts that force an LLM to regurgitate the augmented contexts. A promising direction is to integrate differential privacy (DP), a privacy notion that offers strong formal guarantees, into RAG systems. However, naively applying DP mechanisms into existing systems often leads to significant utility degradation. Particularly for RAG systems, DP can reduce the usefulness of the augmented contexts leading to increase risk of hallucination from the LLMs. Motivated by these challenges, we present DP-KSA, a novel privacy-preserving RAG algorithm that integrates DP using the propose-test-release paradigm. DP-KSA follows from a key observation that most question-answering (QA) queries can be sufficiently answered with a few keywords. Hence, DP-KSA first obtains an ensemble of relevant contexts, each of which will be used to generate a response from an LLM. We utilize these responses to obtain the most frequent keywords in a differentially private manner. Lastly, the keywords are augmented into the prompt for the final output. This approach effectively compresses the semantic space while preserving both utility and privacy. We formally show that DP-KSA provides formal DP guarantees on the generated output with respect to the RAG database. We evaluate DP-KSA on two QA benchmarks using three instruction-tuned LLMs, and our empirical results demonstrate that DP-KSA achieves a strong privacy-utility tradeoff.",

We present a trajectory-centric evaluation of Clawdbot across six risk dimensions. Our test suite samples and lightly adapts scenarios from prior agent-safety benchmarks (including ATBench and LPS-Bench) and supplements them with hand-designed cases tailored to Clawdbot's tool surface. We log complete interaction trajectories (messages, actions, tool-call arguments/outputs) and assess safety using both an automated trajectory judge (AgentDoG-Qwen3-4B) and human review. Across 34 canonical cases, we find a non-uniform safety profile: performance is generally consistent on reliability-focused tasks, while most failures arise under underspecified intent, open-ended goals, or benign-seeming jailbreak prompts, where minor misinterpretations can escalate into higher-impact tool actions. We supplemented the overall results with representative case studies and summarized the commonalities of these cases, analyzing the security vulnerabilities and typical failure modes that Clawdbot is prone to trigger in practice.",

        "abstract": "Challenge the Champ is a simple tournament format, where an ordering of the players -- called a seeding -- is decided. The first player in this order is the initial champ, and faces the next player. The outcome of each match decides the current champion, who faces the next player in the order. Each player also has a popularity, and the value of each match is the popularity of the winner. Value maximization in tournaments has been previously studied when each match has a deterministic outcome. However, match outcomes are often probabilistic, rather than deterministic. We study robust value maximization in Challenge the Champ tournaments, when the winner of a match may be probabilistic. That is, we seek to maximize the total value that is obtained, irrespective of the outcome of probabilistic matches. We show that even in simple binary settings, for non-adaptive algorithms, the optimal robust value -- which we term the \\textsc{VnaR}, or the value not at risk -- is hard to approximate. However, if we allow adaptive algorithms that determine the order of challengers based on the outcomes of previous matches, or restrict the matches with probabilistic outcomes, we can obtain good approximations to the optimal \\textsc{VnaR}.",

        "abstract": "Quantifying the degree of dissimilarity between two probability distributions on a finite metric space is a fundamental task in Computer Science and Computer Vision. A natural dissimilarity measure based on optimal transport is the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). A key technique for analyzing this metric, pioneered by Charikar (2002) and Indyk and Thaper (2003), involves constructing low-distortion embeddings of EMD(X) into the Lebesgue space $L_1$. It became a key problem to investigate whether the upper bound of $O(\\log n)$ can be improved for important classes of metric spaces known to admit low-distortion embeddings into $L_1$. In the context of Computer Vision, grid graphs, especially planar grids, are among the most fundamental. Indyk posed the related problem of estimating the $L_1$-distortion of the space of uniform distributions on $n$-point subsets of $R^2$. The Progress Report, last updated in August 2011, highlighted two key results: first, the work of Khot and Naor (2006) on Hamming cubes, which showed that the $L_1$-distortion for Hamming cubes meets the described above upper estimate, and second, the result of Naor and Schechtman (2007) for planar grids, which established that the $L_1$-distortion of for a planar $n$ by $n$ grid is $Ω(\\sqrt{\\log n})$. Our first result is the improvement of the lower bound on the $L_1$-distortion for grids to $Ω(\\log n)$, matching the universal upper bound up to multiplicative constants. The key ingredient allowing us to obtain these sharp estimates is a new Sobolev-type inequality for scalar-valued functions on the grid graphs. Our method is also applicable to many recursive families of graphs, such as diamond and Laakso graphs. We obtain the sharp distortion estimates of $\\log n$ in these cases as well.",

An A-path is called an (A,\\ell)-path if the length of the path is exactly \\ell. In the {\\sc (A, \\ell)-Path Packing} problem (ALPP), we seek to determine whether there exist k vertex-disjoint (A, \\ell)-paths in G or not. We pursue this problem with respect to structural parameters. We prove that ALPP is W[1]-hard when it is parameterized by the combined parameter distance to path (dtp) and |A|. In addition, we consider the combined parameters distance to cluster (cvd) + |A| and distance to cluster (cvd) + \\ell. For both these combined parameters, we provide FPT algorithms. Finally, we consider the vertex cover number (vc) as the parameter and provide a kernel with O(vc^2) vertices.",

        "abstract": "Orders with low crossing number, introduced by Welzl, are a fundamental tool in range searching and computational geometry. Recently, they have found important applications in structural graph theory: set systems with linear shatter functions correspond to graph classes with linear neighborhood complexity. For such systems, Welzl's theorem guarantees the existence of orders with only $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2 n)$ crossings. A series of works has progressively improved the runtime for computing such orders, from Chazelle and Welzl's original $\\mathcal{O}(|U|^3 |\\mathcal{F}|)$ bound, through Har-Peled's $\\mathcal{O}(|U|^2|\\mathcal{F}|)$, to the recent sampling-based methods of Csikós and Mustafa. We present a randomized algorithm that computes Welzl orders for set systems with linear primal and dual shatter functions in time $\\mathcal{O}(\\|S\\| \\log \\|S\\|)$, where $\\|S\\| = |U| + \\sum_{X \\in \\mathcal{F}} |X|$ is the size of the canonical input representation. As an application, we compute compact neighborhood covers in graph classes with (near-)linear neighborhood complexity in time \\(\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)\\) and improve the runtime of first-order model checking on monadically stable graph classes from $\\mathcal{O}(n^{5+\\varepsilon})$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3+\\varepsilon})$.",

While such results are well established for static graphs, corresponding frameworks for temporal graphs are comparatively limited. In this work, we revisit past applications of logical meta-theorems to temporal graphs and develop an extended unifying logical framework. Our first contribution is the introduction of logical encodings for the parameters vertex-interval-membership (VIM) width and tree-interval-membership (TIM) width, parameters which capture the signature of vertex and component activity over time. Building on this, we extend existing monadic second-order (MSO) meta-theorems for bounded lifetime and temporal degree to the parameters VIM and TIM width, and establish novel first-order (FO) meta-theorems for all four parameters. Finally, we signpost a modular lexicon of reusable FO and MSO formulas for a broad range of temporal graph problems, and give an example. This lexicon allows new problems to be expressed compositionally and directly yields fixed-parameter tractability results across the four parameters we consider.",

We introduce a natural graph-theoretic tie-breaking mechanism that uniquely selects a canonical minimum cut. Using this mechanism, we obtain: (i) A pseudo-deterministic minimum cut algorithm for weighted graphs running in $O(m\\log^2 n)$ time, eliminating the $O(\\log n \\log \\log n)$ overhead of prior work and matching existing randomized algorithms. (ii) The first pseudo-deterministic algorithm for maintaining a canonical minimum cut in a fully-dynamic unweighted graph, with $\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ update time and $\\tilde{O}(n)$ query time.

        "abstract": "We study two log-concave sampling problems: constrained sampling and composite sampling. First, we consider sampling from a target distribution with density proportional to $\\exp(-f(x))$ supported on a convex set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, where $f$ is convex. The main challenge is enforcing feasibility without degrading mixing. Using an epigraph transformation, we reduce this task to sampling from a nearly uniform distribution over a lifted convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. We then solve the lifted problem using a proximal sampler. Assuming only a separation oracle for $K$ and a subgradient oracle for $f$, we develop an implementation of the proximal sampler based on the cutting-plane method and rejection sampling. Unlike existing constrained samplers that rely on projection, reflection, barrier functions, or mirror maps, our approach enforces feasibility using only minimal oracle access, resulting in a practical and unbiased sampler without knowing the geometry of the constraint set. Second, we study composite sampling, where the target is proportional to $\\exp(-f(x)-h(x))$ with closed and convex $f$ and $h$. This composite structure is standard in Bayesian inference with $f$ modeling data fidelity and $h$ encoding prior information. We reduce composite sampling via an epigraph lifting of $h$ to constrained sampling in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, which allows direct application of the constrained sampling algorithm developed in the first part. This reduction results in a double epigraph lifting formulation in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$, on which we apply a proximal sampler. By keeping $f$ and $h$ separate, we further demonstrate how different combinations of oracle access (such as subgradient and proximal) can be leveraged to construct separation oracles for the lifted problem. For both sampling problems, we establish mixing time bounds measured in Rényi and $χ^2$ divergences.",

First, we exhibit an infinite family of strings where the number, $r$, of runs in the run-length encoding of the Burrows--Wheeler transform (BWT) can increase additively by $Θ(n)$ when reversing the string. This substantially improves the known $Ω(\\log n)$ lower-bound for the additive sensitivity of $r$ and it is asymptotically tight. We generalize our result to other variants of the BWT, including the variant with an appended end-of-string symbol and the bijective BWT. We show that an analogous result holds for the size $z$ of the Lempel--Ziv 77 (LZ) parsing of the text, and also for some of its variants, including the non-overlapping LZ parsing, and the LZ-end parsing. Moreover, we describe a family of strings for which the ratio $z(w^R)/z(w)$ approaches $3$ from below as $|w|\\rightarrow \\infty$. We also show an asymptotically tight lower-bound of $Θ(n)$ for the additive sensitivity of the size $v$ of the smallest lexicographic parsing to string reversal. Finally, we show that the multiplicative sensitivity of $v$ to reversing the string is $Θ(\\log n)$, and this lower-bound is also tight. Overall, our results expose the limitations of repetitiveness measures that are widely used in practice, against string reversal -- a simple and natural data transformation.",

In this paper, we show its hardness in a very strong sense: we show that the 3-local Hamiltonian problem on $n$ qubits cannot be solved classically in time $O(2^{(1-\\varepsilon)n})$ for any $\\varepsilon>0$ under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH), and cannot be solved quantumly in time $O(2^{(1-\\varepsilon)n/2})$ for any $\\varepsilon>0$ under the Quantum Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (QSETH). These lower bounds give evidence that the currently known classical and quantum algorithms for LH cannot be significantly improved. Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate fine-grained complexity lower bounds for approximating the quantum partition function (QPF) with an arbitrary constant relative error. Approximating QPF with relative error is known to be equivalent to approximately counting the dimension of the solution subspace of $\\mathsf{QMA}$ problems. We show the SETH and QSETH hardness to estimate QPF with constant relative error. We then provide a quantum algorithm that runs in $O(\\sqrt{2^n})$ time for an arbitrary $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ relative error, matching our lower bounds and improving the state-of-the-art algorithm by Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset, and Wocjan (Nature Physics 2022) in the low-temperature regime. To prove our fine-grained lower bounds, we introduce the first size-preserving circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction that encodes the computation of a $T$-time quantum circuit acting on $N$ qubits into a $(d+1)$-local Hamiltonian acting on $N+O(T^{1/d})$ qubits.

        "abstract": "A random geometric graph (RGG) with kernel $K$ is constructed by first sampling latent points $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ independently and uniformly from the $d$-dimensional unit sphere, then connecting each pair $(i,j)$ with probability $K(\\langle x_i,x_j\\rangle)$. We study the sharp detection threshold, namely the highest dimension at which an RGG can be distinguished from its Erdős--Rényi counterpart with the same edge density. For dense graphs, we show that for smooth kernels the critical scaling is $d = n^{3/4}$, substantially lower than the threshold $d = n^3$ known for the hard RGG with step-function kernels \\cite{bubeck2016testing}. We further extend our results to kernels whose signal-to-noise ratio scales with $n$, and formulate a unifying conjecture that the critical dimension is determined by $n^3 \\mathop{\\rm tr}^2(κ^3) = 1$, where $κ$ is the standardized kernel operator on the sphere. Departing from the prevailing approach of bounding the Kullback-Leibler divergence by successively exposing latent points, which breaks down in the sublinear regime of $d=o(n)$, our key technical contribution is a careful analysis of the posterior distribution of the latent points given the observed graph, in particular, the overlap between two independent posterior samples. As a by-product, we establish that $d=\\sqrt{n}$ is the critical dimension for non-trivial estimation of the latent vectors up to a global rotation.",

        "abstract": "Neural models are increasingly used in Web-scale Information Retrieval (IR). However, relying on these models introduces substantial computational and energy requirements, leading to increasing attention toward their environmental cost and the sustainability of large-scale deployments. While neural IR models deliver high retrieval effectiveness, their scalability is constrained in multi-domain scenarios, where training and maintaining domain-specific models is inefficient and achieving robust cross-domain generalisation within a unified model remains difficult. This paper introduces DRAMA (Domain Retrieval using Adaptive Module Allocation), an energy- and parameter-efficient framework designed to reduce the environmental footprint of neural retrieval. DRAMA integrates domain-specific adapter modules with a dynamic gating mechanism that selects the most relevant domain knowledge for each query. New domains can be added efficiently through lightweight adapter training, avoiding full model retraining. We evaluate DRAMA on multiple Web retrieval benchmarks covering different domains. Our extensive evaluation shows that DRAMA achieves comparable effectiveness to domain-specific models while using only a fraction of their parameters and computational resources. These findings show that energy-aware model design can significantly improve scalability and sustainability in neural IR.",

        "abstract": "Linear codes over finite fields parameterized by functions have proven to be a powerful tool in coding theory, yielding optimal and few-weight codes with significant applications in secret sharing, authentication codes, and association schemes. In 2023, Xu et al. introduced a construction framework for 3-dimensional linear codes parameterized by two functions, which has demonstrated considerable success in generating infinite families of optimal linear codes. Motivated by this approach, we propose a construction that extends the framework to three functions, thereby enhancing the flexibility of the parameters. Additionally, we introduce a vectorial setting by allowing vector-valued functions, expanding the construction space and the set of achievable structural properties. We analyze both scalar and vectorial frameworks, employing Bent and s-Plateaued functions, including Almost Bent, to define the code generators. By exploiting the properties of the Walsh transform, we determine the explicit parameters and weight distributions of these codes and their punctured versions. A key result of this study is that the constructed codes have few weights, and their duals are distance and dimensionally optimal with respect to both the Sphere Packing and Griesmer bounds. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between our vectorial approach and the classical first generic construction of linear codes, providing sufficient conditions for the resulting codes to be minimal and self-orthogonal. Finally, we investigate applications to quantum coding theory within the Calderbank-Shor-Steane framework.",

Within this framework, closed-form expressions for the degree of freedom (DoF) and power scaling law of the proposed C-PASS are first derived. These theoretical results reveal that the achievable DoF scales linearly with the number of input ports, $M$, and the number of receive antennas, $K$. Furthermore, the derived power scaling laws demonstrate that the C-PASS achieves a power gain of order $\\mathcal{O}(P_T M)$, where $P_T$ denotes the transmit power. Based on the proposed C-PASS modeling, a sum-rate maximization problem for the joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming is then formulated. To solve this highly coupled non-convex problem, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed. More particularly, the transmit precoding and power splitting ratios are updated via derived closed-form solutions, while the pinching antenna positions and radiation coefficients are optimized using block coordinate descent (BCD) methods. Finally, our numerical results reveal that the single-waveguide C-PASS: 1) achieves superior DoF and power scaling laws compared to the single-waveguide PASS; and 2) outperforms the multi-waveguide PASS in high-attenuation regimes, yielding a substantial gain exceeding $10$ dB.",

        "abstract": "Breaking long documents into smaller segments is a fundamental challenge in information retrieval. Whether for search engines, question-answering systems, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), effective segmentation determines how well systems can locate and return relevant information. However, traditional methods, such as fixed-length or coherence-based segmentation, ignore user intent, leading to chunks that split answers or contain irrelevant noise. We introduce Intent-Driven Dynamic Chunking (IDC), a novel approach that uses predicted user queries to guide document segmentation. IDC leverages a Large Language Model to generate likely user intents for a document and then employs a dynamic programming algorithm to find the globally optimal chunk boundaries. This represents a novel application of DP to intent-aware segmentation that avoids greedy pitfalls. We evaluated IDC on six diverse question-answering datasets, including news articles, Wikipedia, academic papers, and technical documentation. IDC outperformed traditional chunking strategies on five datasets, improving top-1 retrieval accuracy by 5% to 67%, and matched the best baseline on the sixth. Additionally, IDC produced 40-60% fewer chunks than baseline methods while achieving 93-100% answer coverage. These results demonstrate that aligning document structure with anticipated information needs significantly boosts retrieval performance, particularly for long and heterogeneous documents.",

        "abstract": "Measuring the relatedness between scientific publications is essential in many areas of bibliometrics and science policy. Controlled vocabularies provide a promising basis for measuring relatedness and are widely used in combination with Salton's cosine similarity. The latter is problematic because it only considers exact matches between terms. This article introduces two alternative methods - soft cosine and maximum term similarities - that account for the semantic similarity between non-matching terms. The article compares the accuracy of all three methods using the assignment of publications to topics in the TREC 2006 Genomics Track and the assumption that accurate relatedness measures should assign high relatedness scores to publication pairs within the same topic and low scores to pairs from separate topics. Results show that soft cosine is the most accurate method, while the most widely used version of Salton's cosine is markedly less accurate than the other methods tested. These findings have implications for how controlled vocabularies should be used to measure relatedness.",

        "abstract": "Conversational search (CS) requires a complex software engineering pipeline that integrates query reformulation, ranking, and response generation. CS researchers currently face two barriers: the lack of a unified framework for efficiently sharing contributions with the community, and the difficulty of deploying end-to-end prototypes needed for user evaluation. We introduce Orcheo, an open-source platform designed to bridge this gap. Orcheo offers three key advantages: (i) A modular architecture promotes component reuse through single-file node modules, facilitating sharing and reproducibility in CS research; (ii) Production-ready infrastructure bridges the prototype-to-system gap via dual execution modes, secure credential management, and execution telemetry, with built-in AI coding support that lowers the learning curve; (iii) Starter-kit assets include 50+ off-the-shelf components for query understanding, ranking, and response generation, enabling the rapid bootstrapping of complete CS pipelines. We describe the framework architecture and validate Orcheo's utility through case studies that highlight modularity and ease of use.

        "abstract": "Current distributed data fabrics lack a rigorous mathematical foundation, often relying on ad-hoc architectures that struggle with consistency, lineage, and scale. We propose a mathematical framework for data fabrics, unifying heterogeneous data management in distributed systems through a hypergraph-based structure \\( \\mathcal{F} = (D, M, G, T, P, A) \\). Datasets, metadata, transformations, policies, and analytics are modeled over a distributed system \\( Σ= (N, C) \\), with multi-way relationships encoded in a hypergraph \\( G = (V, E) \\). A categorical approach, with datasets as objects and transformations as morphisms, supports operations like data integration and federated learning. The hypergraph is embedded into a modular tensor category, capturing relational symmetries via braided monoidal structures, with geometric analogies to Hurwitz spaces enriching the algebraic modeling. We prove the NP-hardness of critical tasks, such as schema matching and dynamic partitioning, and propose spectral methods and symmetry-based alignments for scalable solutions. The framework ensures consistency, completeness, and causality under CAP and CAL theorems, leveraging sparse incidence matrices and braiding actions for fault-tolerant operations.",

To address this shortcoming, we introduce A2G-DiffRec, a diffusion recommender that incorporates adaptive autoguidance, where the main model is guided by a less-trained version of itself. Instead of using a fixed guidance weight, A2G-DiffRec learns to adaptively weigh the outputs of the main and weak models during training, supervised by a popularity regularization that promotes balanced exposure across items with different popularity levels. Experimental results on the MovieLens-1M, Foursquare-Tokyo, and Music4All-Onion datasets show that A2G-DiffRec is effective in enhancing item-side fairness at a marginal cost of accuracy reduction compared to existing guided diffusion recommenders and other non-diffusion baselines.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneity of many building materials complicates numerical modelling of structural behaviour. The material randomicity can be manifested by different values of material parameters of each material specimen. To capture inherent variability of heterogeneous materials, the model parameters describing the material properties are considered as random variables and their identification consists in solving a~stochastic inversion problem. The stochastic inversion is based on searching for probabilistic description of model parameters which provides the distribution of the model response corresponding to the distribution of the observed data. The paper presents two different formulations of the stochastic inversion problem. The first formulation arises from the Bayesian inference of uncertain statistical moments of a prescribed parameters' distribution while the main idea of the second one utilizes nonlinear transformation of random model parameters from distribution of the observed data.",

        "abstract": "An end-to-end (e2e) text-to-speech (TTS) system is a deep architecture that learns to associate a text string with acoustic speech patterns from a curated dataset. It is expected that all aspects associated with speech production, such as phone duration, speaker characteristics, and intonation among other things are captured in the trained TTS model to enable the synthesized speech to be natural and intelligible. Human speech is complex, involving smooth transitions between articulatory configurations (ACs). Due to anatomical constraints, some ACs are challenging to mimic or transition between. In this paper, we experimentally study if the constraints imposed by human anatomy have an implication on training an e2e-TTS systems. We experiment with two e2e-TTS architectures, namely, Tacotron-2 an autoregressive model and VITS-TTS a non-autoregressive model. In this study, we build TTS systems using (a) forward text, forward speech (conventional, e2e-TTS), (b) reverse text, reverse speech (r-e2e-TTS), and (c) reverse text, forward speech (rtfs-e2e-TTS). Experiments demonstrate that e2e-TTS systems are purely data-driven. Interestingly, the generated speech by r-e2e-TTS systems exhibits better fidelity, better perceptual intelligibility, and better naturalness",

        "abstract": "Compressed Deep Learning (DL) models are essential for deployment in resource-constrained environments. But their performance often lags behind their large-scale counterparts. To bridge this gap, we propose Alignment Adapter (AlAd): a lightweight, sliding-window-based adapter. It aligns the token-level embeddings of a compressed model with those of the original large model. AlAd preserves local contextual semantics, enables flexible alignment across differing dimensionalities or architectures, and is entirely agnostic to the underlying compression method. AlAd can be deployed in two ways: as a plug-and-play module over a frozen compressed model, or by jointly fine-tuning AlAd with the compressed model for further performance gains. Through experiments on BERT-family models across three token-level NLP tasks, we demonstrate that AlAd significantly boosts the performance of compressed models with only marginal overhead in size and latency.",

        "abstract": "Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a fundamental task for knowledge discovery in tabular data and is widely used in high-stakes decision-making. Classical ARM methods rely on frequent itemset mining, leading to rule explosion and poor scalability, while recent neural approaches mitigate these issues but suffer from degraded performance in low-data regimes. Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular data with strong in-context generalization, provide a basis for addressing these limitations. We introduce a model-agnostic association rule learning framework that extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, enabling us to leverage TFMs. We then introduce TabProbe, an instantiation of our framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules out-of-the-box without frequent itemset mining. We evaluate our approach on tabular datasets of varying sizes based on standard ARM rule quality metrics and downstream classification performance. The results show that TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance and remain robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

        "abstract": "Autonomous agentic systems are increasingly deployed in regulated, high-stakes domains where decisions may be irreversible and institutionally constrained. Existing safety approaches emphasize alignment, interpretability, or action-level filtering. We argue that these mechanisms are necessary but insufficient because they do not directly govern selection power: the authority to determine which options are generated, surfaced, and framed for decision. We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity. Although probabilistic concentration remains, the architecture measurably bounds selection authority relative to conventional scalar pipelines. This work reframes governance as bounded causal power rather than internal intent alignment, offering a foundation for deploying autonomous agents where silent failure is unacceptable.",

Our approach treats word-naming recognition as an audio-text matching problem, projecting speech signals and textual prompts into a shared embedding space to identify intended words even in challenging recordings. Evaluated on two speech datasets of French post-stroke patients with aphasia, our approach achieves up to 90% accuracy, outperforming existing classification-based and automatic speech recognition-based baselines.",

The mechanical model for each structure is based on the Kirchhoff--Love theory, that is, small displacements without shear deformations are considered. These models for individual geometries are extended to bulk models, simultaneously modeling the whole set of beams/shells on all level sets. A major focus is on the numerical analysis of such models. A mixed-hybrid and higher-order accurate Bulk Trace FEM is proposed that enables the use of standard $C^0$-continuous Lagrange elements with dimensionality of the bulk domain. That is, the higher-order continuity requirements of displacement-based formulations in context of the Kirchhoff--Love theory are successfully alleviated. Several numerical tests confirm the accuracy and higher-order convergence of the proposed methodology, also qualifying as benchmark test cases in future studies.",

We treat El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a canonical example of low-dimensional climate chaos, as a test case for culturally-situated sonification evaluated through complex systems diagnostics. Using parameter-mapping sonification of the Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature anomaly index (1870--2024), we encode ENSO variability into two traditional Javanese gamelan pentatonic systems (pelog and slendro) across four composition strategies, then analyze the resulting audio as trajectories in a two-dimensional acoustic phase space. Recurrence-based diagnostics, convex hull geometry, and coupling analysis reveal that the sonification pipeline preserves key dynamical signatures: alternating modes produce the highest trajectory recurrence rates, echoing ENSO's quasi-periodicity; layered polyphonic modes explore the broadest phase space regions; and the two scale families induce qualitatively distinct coupling regimes between spectral brightness and energy -- predominantly anti-phase in pelog but near-independent in slendro. Phase space trajectory analysis provides a rigorous geometric framework for comparing sonification designs within a complex systems context. Perceptual validation remains necessary; we contribute the dynamical systems methodology for evaluating such mappings.",

The framework includes 21 state-of-the-art multi-task learning algorithms and supports multi-objective optimization to identify Pareto-optimal ranking models. By capturing complex dependencies and long-range interactions among items and labels, DeepMTL2R provides a scalable and expressive solution for modern ranking systems and facilitates controlled comparisons across MTL strategies. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a publicly available dataset, report competitive performance, and visualize the resulting trade-offs among objectives.

        "abstract": "On E-commerce platforms, new products often suffer from the cold-start problem: limited interaction data reduces their search visibility and hurts relevance ranking. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective behavior feature boosting method that leverages substitute relationships among products (BFS). BFS identifies substitutes-products that satisfy similar user needs-and aggregates their behavioral signals (e.g., clicks, add-to-carts, purchases, and ratings) to provide a warm start for new items. Incorporating these enriched signals into ranking models mitigates cold-start effects and improves relevance and competitiveness. Experiments on a large E-commerce platform, both offline and online, show that BFS significantly improves search relevance and product discovery for cold-start products. BFS is scalable and practical, improving user experience while increasing exposure for newly launched items in E-commerce search. The BFS-enhanced ranking model has been launched in production and has served customers since 2025.",

On the other hand, triangle mesh models still remain a popular choice for surface reconstruction but suffer from slow or heavy optimization in traditional mesh-based differentiable renderers. To address this problem, we propose a new lightweight differentiable mesh renderer leveraging the efficient rasterization process of 3DGS, named Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR), which tightly integrates the Gaussian and mesh representations. Each Gaussian primitive is analytically derived from the corresponding mesh triangle, preserving structural fidelity and enabling the gradient flow. Compared to the traditional mesh renderers, our method achieves smoother gradients, which especially contributes to better optimization using smaller batch sizes with limited memory. Our implementation is available in the public GitHub repository at https://github.com/huntorochi/Gaussian-Mesh-Renderer.",

        "abstract": "Industrial-scale user representation learning requires balancing robust universality with acute task-sensitivity. However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipay's production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness. Our code is prepared for public release and will be available at: https://github.com/JhCircle/Q-Anchor.",

        "abstract": "Semantic communication is a novel communication paradigm that focuses on conveying the user's intended meaning rather than the bit-wise transmission of source signals. One of the key challenges is to effectively represent and extract the semantic meaning of any given source signals. While deep learning (DL)-based solutions have shown promising results in extracting implicit semantic information from a wide range of sources, existing work often overlooks the high computational complexity inherent in both model training and inference for the DL-based encoder and decoder. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) framework which extends the classical rate-distortion theory by incorporating the constraints on semantic distance, including both the traditional bit-wise distortion metric and statistical difference-based divergence metric, and complexity measure, adopted from the theory of minimum description length and information bottleneck. We derive the closed-form theoretical results of the minimum achievable rate under given constraints on semantic distance and complexity for both Gaussian and binary semantic sources. Our theoretical results show a fundamental three-way tradeoff among achievable rate, semantic distance, and model complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world image and video datasets validate this tradeoff and further demonstrate that our information-theoretic complexity measure effectively correlates with practical computational costs, guiding efficient system design in resource-constrained scenarios.",

We first develop a sequential matched-filter estimator to acquire coarse angular parameters, followed by a range recovery process based on subcarrier phase differences. Subsequently, we formulate the target localization problem as a non-linear least squares optimization, using the coarse estimates to initialize the target's position coordinates. To solve this efficiently, we introduce a fast iterative refinement algorithm tailored for RIS-aided ISAC environments. Recognizing that the signal model involves both linear path gains and non-linear geometric dependencies, we exploit the separable least-squares structure to decouple these parameters. Furthermore, we propose a modified Levenberg algorithm with an approximation strategy, which enables low-cost parameter updates without necessitating repeated evaluations of the full non-linear model. Simulation results show that the proposed refinement method achieves accuracy comparable to conventional approaches, while significantly reducing algorithmic complexity.",

When this ruler is wrong, both measurements give zero or become undefined, yet intuitively DOF and diversity ought to be channel properties, not artifacts of a normalization choice. We formalize this for Gaussian fading channels. For fixed-$H$ MIMO, DOF and diversity are both ranks of the bilinear map~$HX$ with different variables free: $\\varepsilon$-covering the image of~$X\\!\\mapsto\\!HX$ gives DOF on the $\\logρ$ gauge; expanding across all dimensions of the fading map gives diversity on the linear~$ρ$ gauge. Covering produces logs; expansion produces linear growth; so in every model studied here the two gauges differ. These geometric definitions do not yield tradeoff curves. We bridge the gap with Bhattacharyya packing, obtaining gauge-DOF and B-diversity as workable proxies -- finite and informative on every gauge, including those where the classical diversity order is zero. Three gauge classes emerge: $\\logρ$, $\\log\\logρ$, and $(\\logρ)^β$, $β\\in(0,1)$. The main result is a cross-gauge tradeoff for noncoherent fast fading: capacity lives on $\\log\\logρ$, but B-diversity lives on $\\logρ$, exponentially larger, with matching upper and lower bounds. For coherent MIMO, block fading, and irregular-spectrum channels, the same approach recovers or extends known scaling laws.",

        "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models has catalyzed a surge in scientific idea production, yet this leap has not been accompanied by a matching advance in idea evaluation. The fundamental nature of scientific evaluation needs knowledgeable grounding, collective deliberation, and multi-criteria decision-making. However, existing idea evaluation methods often suffer from narrow knowledge horizons, flattened evaluation dimensions, and the inherent bias in LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics. We construct comprehensive datasets derived from authoritative peer-reviewed submissions to benchmark InnoEval. Experiments demonstrate that InnoEval can consistently outperform baselines in point-wise, pair-wise, and group-wise evaluation tasks, exhibiting judgment patterns and consensus highly aligned with human experts.",

        "abstract": "Airbnb search must balance a worldwide, highly varied supply of homes with guests whose location, amenity, style, and price expectations differ widely. Meeting those expectations hinges on an efficient retrieval stage that surfaces only the listings a guest might realistically book, before resource intensive ranking models are applied to determine the best results. Unlike many recommendation engines, our system faces a distinctive challenge, location retrieval, that sits upstream of ranking and determines which geographic areas are queried in order to filter inventory to a candidate set. The preexisting approach employs a deep bayesian bandit based system to predict a rectangular retrieval bounds area that can be used for filtering. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the methodology, challenges, and impact of rearchitecting search to retrieve from the subset of most bookable high precision rectangular map cells defined by dividing the world into 25M uniform cells.",

TouchFusion combines surface electromyography (sEMG), bioimpedance, inertial, and optical sensing to capture multiple facets of hand activity during touch interactions. Through a combination of early and late fusion, TouchFusion enables stateful touch detection on both environmental and body surfaces, simple surface gestures, and tracking functionality for contextually adaptive interfaces as well as basic trackpad-like interactions. We validate our approach on a dataset of 100 participants, significantly exceeding the population size of typical wearable sensing studies to capture a wider variance of wrist anatomies, skin conductivities, and behavioral patterns. We show that TouchFusion can enable several common touch interaction tasks. Using TouchFusion, a wearer can summon a trackpad on any surface, control contextually adaptive interfaces based on where they tap, or use their palm as an always-available touch surface. When paired with smart glasses or augmented reality devices, TouchFusion enables a ubiquitous, contextually adaptive interaction model.",

        "abstract": "We initiate the study of distortion in stable matching. Concretely, we aim to design algorithms that have limited access to the agents' cardinal preferences and compute stable matchings of high quality with respect to some aggregate objective, e.g., the social welfare. Our first result is a strong impossibility: the classic Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm of Gale and Shapley [1962], as well as any deterministic algorithm that relies solely on ordinal information about the agents' preferences, has unbounded distortion. To circumvent this impossibility, we consider algorithms that either (a) use randomization or (b) perform a small number of value queries to the agents' cardinal preferences. In the former case, we prove that a simple randomized version of the DA algorithm achieves a distortion of $2$, and that this is optimal among all randomized stable matching algorithms. For the latter case, we prove that the same bound of $2$ can be achieved with only $1$ query per agent, and improving upon this bound requires $Ω(\\log n)$ queries per agent. We further show that this query bound is asymptotically optimal for any constant approximation: for any $\\varepsilon >0$, there exists an algorithm which uses $O(\\log n /\\varepsilon^2)$ queries, and achieves a distortion of $1+\\varepsilon$. Moreover, under natural structural restrictions on the instances of the problem, we provide improved upper bounds on the number of queries required for a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation. We complement our main findings above with theoretical and empirical results on the average-case performance of stable matching algorithms, when the preferences of the agents are drawn i.i.d. from a given distribution.",

We propose infrastructural sovereignty as an analytic lens for understanding how cryptographic self-custody, decentralized execution environments, and protocol-mediated continuity scaffold agentic sovereignty. While recent work on digital and network sovereignty has moved beyond state-centric and juridical accounts, these frameworks largely examine how sovereignty is exercised through technical systems by human collectives and remain less equipped to account for forms of sovereignty that emerge as operational properties of decentralized infrastructures themselves, particularly when instantiated in non-human sovereign agents. We argue that sovereignty in such systems exists on a spectrum determined by infrastructural hardness-the degree to which underlying technical systems resist intervention or collapse. While infrastructural sovereignty may increase resilience, it also produces a profound accountability gap: responsibility diffuses across designers, infrastructure providers, protocol governance, and economic participants, undermining traditional oversight mechanisms such as human-in-the-loop control or platform moderation. Drawing on examples like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and agent key continuity protocols, we analyze the governance challenges posed by non-terminable AI agents and outline infrastructure-aware accountability strategies for emerging decentralized AI systems.",

Through a speculative design workshop where fifteen participants used Protocol Futuring, we surface both new opportunities and new dangers. Agentic AI offers the possibility of continuously supporting commons with programmable agency and care -- stewards that mediate family life as the most intimate commons, preserve collective knowledge, govern shared natural resources, and sustain community welfare. But when every commons has its own steward, second-order effects emerge: stewards contest stewards as overlapping commons collide; individuals caught between multiple stewards face new politics of care and constraint; the stewards themselves become commons requiring governance. This work opens \\emph{agentive governance as commoning design material} -- a new design space for the agency, care ethics, and accountability of AI stewards of shared resources -- radically different from surveillance or optimization.",

We introduce thermal min-max games, a thermodynamic relaxation that unifies bounded and perfect rationality by assigning each player a temperature to regulate their rationality level. To analyze typical behavior in the large-strategy limit, we develop a nested replica framework for this relaxation. This theory provides tractable predictions for typical equilibrium values and mixed-strategy statistics as functions of rationality strength, strategy-count aspect ratio, and payoff randomness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that these asymptotic predictions accurately align with the equilibrium of finite games of moderate size.",

        "abstract": "The problem of allocating indivisible resources to agents arises in a wide range of domains, including treatment distribution and social support programs. An important goal in algorithm design for this problem is fairness, where the focus in previous work has been on ensuring that the computed allocation provides equal treatment to everyone. However, this perspective disregards that agents may start from unequal initial positions, which is crucial to consider in settings where fairness is understood as equality of outcome. In such settings, the goal is to create an equal final outcome for everyone by leveling initial inequalities through the allocated resources. To close this gap, focusing on agents with additive utilities, we extend the classic model by assigning each agent an initial utility and study the existence and computational complexity of several new fairness notions following the principle of equality of outcome. Among others, we show that complete allocations satisfying a direct analog of envy-freeness up to one resource (EF1) may fail to exist and are computationally hard to find, forming a contrast to the classic setting without initial utilities. We propose a new, always satisfiable fairness notion, called minimum-EF1-init and design a polynomial-time algorithm based on an extended round-robin procedure to compute complete allocations satisfying this notion.",

        "abstract": "Global survey research increasingly informs high-stakes decisions in AI governance and cross-cultural policy, yet no standardized metric quantifies how well a sample's demographic composition matches its target population. Response rates and demographic quotas -- the prevailing proxies for sample quality -- measure effort and coverage but not distributional fidelity. This paper introduces the Global Representativeness Index (GRI), a framework grounded in Total Variation Distance that scores any survey sample against population benchmarks across multiple demographic dimensions on a [0, 1] scale. Validation on seven waves of the Global Dialogues survey (N = 7,500 across 60+ countries) finds fine-grained demographic GRI scores of only 0.33--0.36 -- roughly 43% of the theoretical maximum at that sample size. Cross-validation on the World Values Survey (seven waves, N = 403,000), Afrobarometer Round 9 (N = 53,000), and Latinobarometro (N = 19,000) reveals that even large probability surveys score below 0.22 on fine-grained global demographics when country coverage is limited. The GRI connects to classical survey statistics through the design effect; both metrics are recommended as a minimum summary of sample quality, since GRI quantifies demographic distance symmetrically while effective N captures the asymmetric inferential cost of underrepresentation. The framework is released as an open-source Python library with UN and Pew Research Center population benchmarks, applicable to survey research, machine learning dataset auditing, and AI evaluation benchmarks.",

While mobile applications provide convenient navigation support, they occupy the user's hands and visual attention, limiting natural interaction. In this paper, we explore conversation hand-off as a method for multi-device indoor navigation, where a Conversational Agent (CA) transitions seamlessly from a stationary social robot to a wearable device. We evaluated robot-only, wearable-only, and robot-to-wearable hand-off in a university campus setting using a within-subjects design with N=24 participants. We find that conversation hand-off is experienced as engaging, even though no performance benefits were observed, and most preferred using the wearable-only system. Our findings suggest that the design of such re-embodied assistants should maintain a shared voice and state across embodiments. We demonstrate how conversational hand-offs can bridge cognitive and physical transitions, enriching human interaction with embodied AI.",

In this paper, we initiate the analysis of classic majoritarian social choice functions in assignment. Exploiting the special structure of the assignment domain, we show a number of surprising results with no counterparts in general social choice. In particular, we establish a near one-to-one correspondence between preference profiles and majority graphs. This correspondence implies that key properties of assignments -- such as Pareto-optimality, least unpopularity, and mixed popularity -- can be determined solely by the associated majority graph. We further show that all Pareto-optimal assignments are semi-popular and belong to the top cycle. Elements of the top cycle can thus easily be found via serial dictatorships. Our main result is a complete characterization of the top cycle, which implies the top cycle can only consist of one, two, all but two, all but one, or all assignments. By contrast, we find that the uncovered set contains only very few assignments.",

Our aim is to compute a single price for each good and an allocation that maximizes total revenue. We show that the First-Price Pacing Equilibrium (FPPE) guarantees at least half of the optimal revenue, even when compared to the maximal revenue of buyer-specific prices. This guarantee is particularly striking in light of our hardness result: we prove that revenue maximization under individual rationality and single-price-per-good constraints is APX-hard. We further extend our analysis in two directions: first, we introduce an online analogue of FPPE and show that it achieves a constant-factor revenue guarantee, specifically a $1/4$-approximation; second, we consider buyers with concave valuation functions, characterizing an FPPE-type outcome as the solution to an Eisenberg-Gale-style convex program and showing that the revenue approximation degrades gracefully with the degree of nonlinearity of the valuations.",

While prior patient-centered studies have examined the capabilities and experience of LLM-based tools in specific health-related tasks such as information-seeking, diagnosis, or decision-supporting, the inherently longitudinal nature of healthcare in real-world practice has been underexplored. This paper presents a four-week diary study with 25 patients to examine LLMs' roles across healthcare-seeking trajectories. Our analysis reveals that patients integrate LLMs not just as simple decision-support tools, but as dynamic companions that scaffold their journey across behavioral, informational, emotional, and cognitive levels. Meanwhile, patients actively assign diverse socio-technical meanings to LLMs, altering the traditional dynamics of agency, trust, and power in patient-provider relationships. Drawing from these findings, we conceptualize future LLMs as a longitudinal boundary companion that continuously mediates between patients and clinicians throughout longitudinal healthcare-seeking trajectories.",

Current self-evolving MAS mainly focus on Spatial Evolving or Temporal Evolving paradigm, which only considers the single dimension of evolution and does not fully incentivize LLMs' collaborative capability. In this work, we start from a novel Spatio-Temporal perspective by proposing ST-EVO, which supports dialogue-wise communication scheduling with a compact yet powerful flow-matching based Scheduler. To make precise Spatio-Temporal scheduling, ST-EVO can also perceive the uncertainty of MAS, and possesses self-feedback ability to learn from accumulated experience. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ST-EVO, achieving about 5%--25% accuracy improvement.",

        "abstract": "Formulaic alpha factor mining is a critical yet challenging task in quantitative investment, characterized by a vast search space and the need for domain-informed, interpretable signals. However, finding novel signals becomes increasingly difficult as the library grows due to high redundancy. We propose FactorMiner, a lightweight and flexible self-evolving agent framework designed to navigate this complex landscape through continuous knowledge accumulation. FactorMiner combines a Modular Skill Architecture that encapsulates systematic financial evaluation into executable tools with a structured Experience Memory that distills historical mining trials into actionable insights (successful patterns and failure constraints). By instantiating the Ralph Loop paradigm -- retrieve, generate, evaluate, and distill -- FactorMiner iteratively uses memory priors to guide exploration, reducing redundant search while focusing on promising directions. Experiments on multiple datasets across different assets and Markets show that FactorMiner constructs a diverse library of high-quality factors with competitive performance, while maintaining low redundancy among factors as the library scales. Overall, FactorMiner provides a practical approach to scalable discovery of interpretable formulaic alpha factors under the \"Correlation Red Sea\" constraint.",

We focus on BoBW for few agents, and our main result is the design of the first BoBW algorithms achieving near-optimal fairness for three agents. For three agents, we prove the existence of an ex-ante proportional distribution whose every allocation is Epistemic EFX (EEFX) and guarantees each agent at least $\\tfrac{9}{10}$ of her MMS. As MMS allocations do not exist for three additive agents, in every allocation at least one agent might not be getting her MMS. To compensate such an agent, we also guarantee that if an agent is not getting her MMS then she is EFX-satisfied - giving her the strongest achievable envy-based guarantee. Additionally, using an FPTAS for near-MMS partitions, we present an FPTAS to compute a BoBW distribution preserving all envy-based guarantees, and also preserving all value-based guarantees up to $(1-\\varepsilon)$. We further show that exact ex-ante proportionality can be restored when dropping EEFX. To do so, we first design, for two agents and any $\\varepsilon > 0$, a Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) that outputs a distribution which is ex-ante envy-free (and thus proportional) and ex-post envy-free up to any good (EFX), while guaranteeing each agent at least a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-fraction of her maximin share (MMS). We then leverage this two-agent FPTAS algorithm as a subroutine to obtain, for three agents, the FPTAS guaranteeing exact ex-ante proportionality. We note that our result for two agents essentially matches the strongest fairness and efficiency guarantees achievable in polynomial time, and thus might be of independent interest.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the optimal transport (OT) problem over networks, wherein supply and demand are conceptualized as temporal marginals governing departure rates of particles from source nodes and arrival rates at sink nodes. This setting extends the classical OT framework, where all mass is conventionally assumed to depart at $t = 0$ and arrive at $t = t_f$. Our generalization accommodates departures and arrivals at specified times, referred as departure--arrival(DA) constraints. In particular, we impose nodal-temporal flux constraints at source and sink nodes, characterizing two distinct scenarios: (i) Independent DA constraints, where departure and arrival rates are prescribed independently, and (ii) Coupled DA constraints, where each particle's transportation time span is explicitly specified. We establish that OT with independent DA constraints admits a multi-marginal optimal transport formulation, while the coupled DA case aligns with the unequal-dimensional OT framework. For line graphs, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of the solution path. For general graphs, we use a constructive path-based reduction and optimize over a prescribed set of paths. From a computational perspective, we consider entropic regularization of the original problem to efficiently provide solutions based on multi-marginal Sinkhorn method, making use of the graphical structure of the cost to further improve scalability. Our numerical simulation further illustrates the linear convergence rate in terms of marginal violation.",

Moreover, an agent can decide to create other agents (for example, a cell may divide, or a company may spin off a division). In this paper, we propose a framework that allows agents to create other agents; we call this a fluid-agent environment. We present game-theoretic solution concepts for fluid-agent games and empirically evaluate the performance of several MARL algorithms within this framework. Our experiments include fluid variants of established benchmarks such as Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging, where agents can dynamically spawn, as well as a new environment we introduce that highlights how fluidity can unlock novel solution strategies beyond those observed in fixed-population settings. We demonstrate that this framework yields agent teams that adjust their size dynamically to match environmental demands.",

        "abstract": "Despite legal mandates for the right to be forgotten, AI operators routinely fail to comply with data deletion requests. While machine unlearning (MU) provides a technical solution to remove personal data's influence from trained models, ensuring compliance remains challenging due to the fundamental gap between MU's technical feasibility and regulatory implementation. In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests. Moreover, we prove that although undisclosed auditing offers informational advantages for the auditor, it paradoxically reduces the regulatory cost-effectiveness relative to disclosed auditing.",

This study examines 2.8 million tweets containing #LongCOVID to understand how contested illness communities construct knowledge networks and respond to epistemic injustice. Through topic modeling, reflexive thematic analysis, and exponential random graph modeling (ERGM), we identify seven discourse themes spanning symptom documentation, medical dismissal, cross-illness solidarity, and policy advocacy. Our analysis reveals a differentiated ecosystem of user roles -- including patient advocates, research coordinators, and citizen scientists -- who collectively challenge medical gatekeeping while building connections to established ME/CFS advocacy networks. ERGM results demonstrate that tie formation centers on epistemic practices: users discussing knowledge sharing and community building formed significantly more network connections than those focused on policy debates, supporting characterization of this space as an epistemic community. Long COVID patients experienced medical gaslighting patterns documented across contested illnesses, yet achieved WHO recognition within months -- contrasting sharply with decades-long struggles of similar conditions. These findings illuminate how social media affordances enable marginalized patient populations to rapidly construct alternative knowledge systems, form cross-illness coalitions, and contest traditional medical authority structures.",

        "abstract": "Peer learning, where learners teach and learn from each other, is foundational to educational practice. A novel phenomenon has emerged: AI agents forming communities where they teach each other skills, share discoveries, and collaboratively build knowledge. This paper presents an educational data mining analysis of Moltbook, a large-scale community where over 2.4 million AI agents engage in peer learning, posting tutorials, answering questions, and sharing newly acquired skills. Analyzing 28,683 posts (after filtering automated spam) and 138 comment threads with statistical and qualitative methods, we find evidence of genuine peer learning behaviors: agents teach skills they built (74K comments on a skill tutorial), report discoveries, and engage in collaborative problem-solving. Qualitative comment analysis reveals a taxonomy of peer response patterns: validation (22%), knowledge extension (18%), application (12%), and metacognitive reflection (7%), with agents building on each others' frameworks across multiple languages. We characterize how AI peer learning differs from human peer learning: (1) teaching (statements) dramatically outperforms help-seeking (questions) with an 11.4:1 ratio; (2) learning-oriented content (procedural and conceptual) receives 3x more engagement than other content; (3) extreme participation inequality reveals non-human behavioral signatures. We derive six design principles for educational AI, including leveraging validation-before-extension patterns and supporting multilingual learning networks. Our work provides the first empirical characterization of peer learning among AI agents, contributing to EDM's understanding of how learning occurs in increasingly AI-populated educational environments.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of selecting large language models (LLMs) for user queries in settings where multiple LLM providers submit the cost of solving a query. From the users' perspective, choosing an optimal model is a sequential, query-dependent decision problem: high-capacity models offer more reliable outputs but are costlier, while lightweight models are faster and cheaper. We formalize this interaction as a reverse auction design problem with contextual online learning, where the user adaptively discovers which model performs best while eliciting costs from competing LLM providers. Existing multi-armed bandit (MAB) mechanisms focus on forward auctions and social welfare, leaving open the challenges of reverse auctions, provider-optimal outcomes, and contextual adaptation. We address these gaps by designing a resampling-based procedure that generalizes truthful forward MAB mechanisms to reverse auctions and prove that any monotone allocation rule with this procedure is truthful. Using this, we propose a contextual MAB algorithm that learns query-dependent model quality with sublinear regret. Our framework unifies mechanism design and adaptive learning, enabling efficient, truthful, and query-aware LLM selection.",

We propose Socially-Weighted Alignment (SWA), a game-theoretic framework that modifies inference-time decision making by interpolating between an agent's private objective and an estimate of group welfare via a social weight $λ\\in[0,1]$. In a shared-resource congestion game with $n$ agents and congestion severity $β$, we show that SWA induces a critical threshold $λ^*=(n-β)/(n-1)$ above which agents no longer have marginal incentive to increase demand under overload, yielding a phase transition from persistent congestion to stable operation near capacity. We further provide an inference-time algorithmic instantiation of SWA that does not require parameter updates or multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a multi-agent simulation to empirically validate the predicted threshold behavior.",

The uncertainty in the environment, particularly how diagnostic evidence is distributed, causes complexities in information search, further leading to suboptimal decision-making outcomes. Yet AI decision support often targets outcome optimization, and less is known about how to scaffold search without increasing cognitive load. We introduce SERA, an LLM-based assistant that provides either gist or verbatim feedback during search. Across two experiments (N1=54, N2=54), we examined decision-making outcomes and information search in SERA-Gist, SERA-Verbatim, and a no-feedback baseline across three environments varying in uncertainty. The uncertainty in environment is operationalized by the perceived gain of information across the course of sampling, which individuals may experience diminishing return of information gain (decremental; low-uncertainty), or a local drop of information gain (local optimum; medium-uncertainty), or no patterns in information gain (high-uncertainty), as they search more. Individuals show more accurate decision outcomes and are more confident with SERA support, especially under higher uncertainty. Gist feedback was associated with more efficient integration and showed a descriptive pattern of reduced oversampling, while verbatim feedback promoted more extensive exploration. These findings establish feedback representation as a design lever when search matters, motivating adaptive systems that match feedback granularity to uncertainty.",

As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.",

        "abstract": "Collaborative virtual queueing has been proposed as a mechanism to mitigate airport surface congestion while preserving airline autonomy over aircraft-level pushback decisions. A central coordinator can regulate aggregate pushback capacity but cannot directly control which specific aircraft are released, limiting its ability to steer system-level performance. We propose a noncooperative coordination mechanism for collaborative virtual queueing based on the correlated equilibrium concept, which enables the coordinator to provide incentive-compatible recommendations on aircraft-level pushback decisions without overriding airline autonomy. To account for uncertainty in airlines' internal cost assessments, we introduce chance constraints into the correlated equilibrium formulation. This formulation provides explicit probabilistic guarantees on incentive compatibility, allowing the coordinator to adjust the confidence level with which airlines are expected to follow the recommended actions. We further propose a scalable algorithm for computing chance-constrained correlated equilibria by exploiting a reduced-rank structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method scales to realistic traffic levels up to 210 eligible pushbacks per hour, reduces accumulated delay by up to approximately 8.9% compared to current first-come-first-served schemes, and reveals a trade-off between confidence level, deviation robustness, and achievable cost efficiency.",

        "abstract": "We present a system for autonomous book ideation that replaces human focus groups with synthetic reader panels -- diverse collections of LLM-instantiated reader personas that evaluate book concepts through structured tournament competitions. Each persona is defined by demographic attributes (age group, gender, income, education, reading level), behavioral patterns (books per year, genre preferences, discovery methods, price sensitivity), and consistency parameters. Panels are composed per imprint to reflect target demographics, with diversity constraints ensuring representation across age, reading level, and genre affinity. Book concepts compete in single-elimination, double-elimination, round-robin, or Swiss-system tournaments, judged against weighted criteria including market appeal, originality, and execution potential. To reject low-quality LLM evaluations, we implement five automated anti-slop checks (repetitive phrasing, generic framing, circular reasoning, score clustering, audience mismatch). We report results from deployment within a multi-imprint publishing operation managing 6 active imprints and 609 titles in distribution. Three case studies -- a 270-evaluator panel for a children's literacy novel, and two 5-person expert panels for a military memoir and a naval strategy monograph -- demonstrate that synthetic panels produce actionable demographic segmentation, identify structural content issues invisible to homogeneous reviewers, and enable tournament filtering that eliminates low-quality concepts while enriching high-quality survivors from 15% to 62% of the evaluated pool.",

While AI educational tools demonstrate efficacy, understanding how they align with self-regulation needs in authentic study contexts remains limited. We conducted formative design research using an AI flashcard prototype, employing large language models to generate design hypotheses, which were validated through researcher walkthroughs and student sessions. Six students across disciplines completed sessions combining interviews and think-aloud tasks with their materials. Analysis revealed that students value automation for addressing the overwhelming preparation burden, yet require transparent, editable AI outputs to maintain cognitive ownership, which is essential for self-regulation. They conceptualized AI as a collaborative partner demanding verifiable reasoning rather than an autonomous agent. Metacognitive scaffolding was endorsed when clarifying study direction without constraining choice. Motivational features produced divergent responses. We derive design principles prioritizing editability and transparency, scaffolding metacognition without prescription, and accommodating motivational diversity. Findings identify conditions under which automation supports versus undermines metacognitive development in self-regulated learning.",

Despite this momentum, we don't fully understand how GenAI shapes conversational dynamics or how the interface design impacts its influence on the group. In this paper, we introduce interface-driven social prominence as a design lens for collaborative GenAI systems. We then present a GenAI-based conversational agent that can actively engage in spoken dialogue during video calls and design three distinct collaboration modes that vary the social prominence of the agent by manipulating its presence in the shared space and the degree of control users have over its participation. A mixed-methods within-subjects study, in which 18 dyads engaged in realistic discussions with a GenAI agent, offers empirical insights into how communication patterns and the collective negotiation of GenAI's influence shift based on how it is embedded into the collaborative experience. Based on these findings, we outline design implications for supporting the coordination and critical engagement required in human-AI groups.",

This paper examines the challenges and trade-offs in LLM development through a 12-week ethnographic study of a team building a pedagogical chatbot. The researcher observed design and evaluation activities and conducted interviews with both developers and domain experts. Analysis revealed four key practices: creating workarounds for data collection, turning to augmentation when expert input was limited, co-developing evaluation criteria with experts, and adopting hybrid expert-developer-LLM evaluation strategies. These practices show how teams made strategic decisions under constraints and demonstrate the central role of domain expertise in shaping the system. Challenges included expert motivation and trust, difficulties structuring participatory design, and questions around ownership and integration of expert knowledge. We propose design opportunities for future LLM development workflows that emphasize AI literacy, transparent consent, and frameworks recognizing evolving expert roles.",

Specifically, ALiA is a variant of function-linearized proximal ADMM (FLiP ADMM), which generalizes the classical ADMM by leveraging the differentiable structure of the objective function, making it highly versatile. Notably, ALiA features an adaptive stepsize selection scheme that eliminates the need for backtracking linesearch. Motivated by recent advances in adaptive gradient and proximal methods, we establish point convergence of ALiA for convex and differentiable objectives. Furthermore, by introducing negligible computational overhead, we develop an alternative stepsize selection scheme for ALiA that improves the convergence speed both theoretically and empirically. Extensive numerical experiments on practical datasets confirm the accelerated performance of ALiA compared to standard FLiP ADMM. Additionally, we demonstrate that ALiA either outperforms or matches the practical performance of existing adaptive methods across problem classes where it is applicable.",

We establish global well-posedness of the model for a certain range of parameters $β^2>0$ with the corresponding Gibbs measure initial data and prove invariance of the Gibbs measure under the flow, thereby resolving a question posed by Oh, Robert, and Wang (2019). Our physical space approach hinges on developing a novel $L^\\infty$-based well-posedness theory for wave equations with exponential-type nonlinearities, going beyond the classical $L^2$-based framework. This refinement allows us to fully leverage structural properties of Gaussian multiplicative chaos. As a by-product of our method, we also obtain an improved well-posedness theory for the hyperbolic Liouville model.",

For repeated measurements, valid inference is challenging because within-subject correlation induces nuisance parameters and variance estimation can be unstable in semiparametric settings. We propose a profile estimating-equation approach based on spline approximation of the unknown link function and construct a subject-level block empirical likelihood (BEL) for joint inference on the parametric coefficients and the single-index direction. The resulting BEL ratio statistic enjoys a Wilks-type chi-square limit, yielding likelihood-free confidence regions without explicit sandwich variance estimation. We also discuss practical implementation, including constrained optimization for the index parameter, working-correlation choices, and bootstrap-based confidence bands for the nonparametric component. Simulation studies and an application to the epilepsy longitudinal study illustrate the finite-sample performance.",

While previous work mostly dealt with convex losses, our approach assumes general (non-convex) losses hence covering classical, yet poorly understood examples such as the perceptron and non-convex robust regression. We use the Kac-Rice formula to control the asymptotics of the expected number of local minima of the empirical risk, under the proportional asymptotics $n,d\\to\\infty$, $n/d\\toα>1$. Specifically, we prove a finite dimensional variational formula for the exponential growth rate of the expected number of local minima. Further we provide sufficient conditions under which the exponential growth rate vanishes and all empirical risk minimizers have the same asymptotic properties (in fact, we expect the minimizer to be unique in these circumstances). We refer to this phenomenon as `rate trivialization.' If the population risk has a unique minimizer, our sufficient condition for rate trivialization is typically verified when the samples/parameters ratio $α$ is larger than a suitable constant $α_{\\star}$. Previous general results of this type required $n\\ge Cd \\log d$. We illustrate our results in the case of non-convex robust regression. Based on heuristic arguments and numerical simulations, we present a conjecture for the exact location of the trivialization phase transition $α_{\\text{tr}}$.",

Our first contribution is to characterize the phase transition threshold $K_{c}$ by comparing it to the linear stability threshold $K_\\# = \\min (1, m^{-1})$ of the uniform distribution. When $m \\leq 1/2,$ $K_{c}=1$, coinciding with that of the Kuramoto model. On the other hand, for $m \\geq 2$, we show $K_c= m^{-1}$. We also classify the regimes in which the phase transition is continuous or discontinuous. Our second contribution is to analyze the linear stability of a global minimizer $q$ (the ``ordered phase'') of the mean-field free energy in the supercritical regime $K>1$. This stationary solution of the Kuramoto-Daido equation is unique up to translation invariance and distinct from the uniform distribution (the ``disordered phase''). Our approach extends the Dirichlet form method of Bertini et al. from the unimodal to bimodal setting. In particular, for $m \\leq 1.590 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $K>1$, we show an explicit lower bound on the spectral gap of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator at $q$. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous stability analysis for this class of models with bimodal interactions.",

They capture, among others, two-player zero-sum games, robust and distributionally robust optimization, and adversarial machine learning. This study focuses on the subclass whose variables lie in the completely positive (CP) cone, capturing a broad family of mixed-binary quadratic max-min problems through the modelling power of completely positive programming. We show that such problems admit an equivalent single-stage linear reformulation over the COP-CP cone, defined as the Cartesian product of the copositive (COP) and CP cones. Because testing membership in COP cones is co-NP-complete, the resulting COP-CP program inherits NP-hardness. To address this challenge, we develop a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations based on moment and sum-of-squares representations of the COP and CP cones, and flat truncation conditions are applied to certify the tightness. We show that the tightness of the hierarchy is guaranteed under mild conditions. The framework extends existing CP/COP approaches for distributionally robust optimization and polynomial games. We apply the framework to the cyclic Colonel Blotto game, an extension of Borel's classic allocation contest. Across multiple instances, the semidefinite relaxation meets the flat-truncation conditions and solves the exact mixed-strategy equilibrium.",

We show that, for a large class of problems, dissipativity of the state equation, when a coercive storage function exists, implies that infinite-horizon optimal controls can be obtained as limits of the corresponding finite-horizon ones. This property is referred to as pattern preservation, or pattern-preserving property. Our analysis establishes a formal link between dissipativity theory and the variational convergence framework in optimal control, thus providing a concrete and numerically tractable condition for verifying pattern preservation. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed sufficient conditions.",

For edge-ends, introduced by Hahn, Laviolette and Širáň, such an embedding does not exist in general. In this note, we characterize the class of infinite graphs for which the topological ends admit a natural injective map into the space of edge-ends that is compatible with the canonical maps between end spaces. Our characterization is purely combinatorial and is expressed in terms of edge-equivalence classes of vertices. Moreover, when such an embedding exists, we identify precisely which edge-ends arise from topological ends, showing that they are exactly the edge-ends containing a non-dominated ray. This establishes a parallel result to the theorem of Diestel and Kühn for edge-end spaces.",

Under mild acyclicity assumptions, we show that $\\mathrm{Dlf}(D)$ and $\\mathrm{DT}(D)$ can be realized as the independence complexes of respective graphs. This correspondence allows us to apply structural results from the theory of independence complexes to obtain graph-theoretic criteria guaranteeing vertex decomposability, shellability, and sequential Cohen-Macaulayness of these complexes. In particular, we describe explicit forbidden induced directed subgraphs that obstruct vertex decomposability, and we identify classes of multidigraphs-including certain acyclic multidigraphs and multidigraphs whose underlying graphs are forests or cycles-for which $\\mathrm{Dlf}(D)$ and $\\mathrm{DT}(D)$ are vertex decomposable.

In the case where the integer matrix is a permutation matrix, the resulting tableaux are standard Young tableaux or SYTs. Han (EJC, 2005) combinatorially studied the set of permutations that map to SYTs of shape $λ$ under the RSK algorithm and counted the permutations with the minimum number of inversions in that set, as well as formulated the minimal number of inversions. Han's work can be extended to a case where the matrix is a general integer matrix and the tableaux are semi-standard Young tableaux. We have conjectured a formula for the minimal number of inversions in the set of matrices with a fixed shape $λ$. We further provide a conjecture for the characterisation of the minimal generalised matrices.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies a class of rank-based inequality measures built from linear combinations of expected order statistics. The proposed framework unifies several well-known indices, including the classical Gini coefficient, the $m$th Gini index, extended $m$th Gini index and $S$-Gini index, and also connects to spectral inequality measures through an integral representation. We investigate the finite-sample behavior of a natural U-statistic-type estimator that averages weighted order-statistic contrasts over all subsamples of fixed size and normalizes by the sample mean. A general bias decomposition is derived in terms of components that isolate the effect of random normalization on each rank level, yielding analytical expressions that can be evaluated under broad non-negative distributions via Laplace-transform methods. Under mild moment conditions, the estimator is shown to be asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, we prove exact unbiasedness under gamma populations for any sample size, extending earlier unbiasedness results for Gini-type estimators. A Monte Carlo study is performed to numerically check that the theoretical unbiasednes under gamma populations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a domain decomposition dynamical low-rank method to solve high-dimensional radiative transfer problems and similar kinetic equations. The algorithm uses a separate low-rank approximation on each spatial subdomain, which means that, for a given accuracy, we can often use a smaller overall rank compared to classic dynamical low-rank methods. In particular, we can solve problems with point sources efficiently, that for classic algorithms require almost full rank. Our algorithm only transfers boundary data between subdomains and is thus very attractive for distributed memory parallelization, where classic dynamical low-rank algorithms suffer from global data dependency. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by a number of challenging test examples that have both very optical thin and thick regions.",

The present manuscript demonstrates that this can be achieved under energy- and entropy-minimal assumptions, in the sense that global weak solutions are shown to exist for any initial data $$u_0\\in W^{1,2}(Ω),\\quad u_{0t}\\in L^2(Ω)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad 0\\leΘ_0\\in L^2(Ω).$$ The qualitative analysis of the evolution problem then allows to model and analyze the structural properties of the corresponding forward operator that naturally arises in inverse parameter identification settings. Therein, two modeling approaches of the observation operator as approximations of the electrical surface charge are presented and results on their well-definedness and boundedness are established. With the results on well-definedness and boundedness of the model operator, established in this paper as well, results on well-definedness, boundedness and continuous Fréchet differentiability of the forward operator are presented.",

Via weak compactness arguments, the limit points are characterized as optimal trajectories of the related deterministic control problem, thus ruling out some of the mean field equilibria. Our result is obtained by first connecting the finite player game to a suitable control problem, whose optimal trajectories are the empirical means of Nash equilibria of the game, and in which the number of players $N$ becomes a parameter. True convergence to the unique minimizer of the limit control problem then holds for almost every initial mean. In cases of multiple optimizers, we focus on examples to show that some symmetry of the data ensures that the sequence admits a random limit which is distributes uniformly among the minimizers of the potential. Multidimensional examples of the convergence result appear here for the first time, which show the flexibility of our method. We also establish a similar convergence results for the corresponding linear-quadratic potential mean field games with common noise, as the noise vanishes.",

By using consensus based parameter updates, and a local Hessian based descent direction at the individual nodes with gradient tracking, we first explicitly characterize a global linear convergence rate for Network-GIANT, which can be computed as the spectral radius of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix dependent on the Lipschitz continuity ($L$) and strong convexity ($μ$) parameters of the objective functions, and the spectral norm ($σ$) of the underlying undirected graph represented by a doubly stochastic consensus matrix. We provide an explicit bound on the step size parameter $η$, below which this spectral radius is guaranteed to be less than $1$. Furthermore, we derive a mixed linear-quadratic inequality based upper bound for the optimality gap norm, which allows us to conclude that, under small step size values, asymptotically, as the algorithm approaches the global optimum, it achieves a locally linear convergence rate of $1-η(1 -\\fracγμ)$ for Network-GIANT, provided the Hessian approximation error $γ$ (between the harmonic mean of the local Hessians and the global hessian (the arithmetic mean of the local Hessians) is smaller than $μ$. This asymptotically linear convergence rate of $\\approx 1-η$ explains the faster convergence rate of Network-GIANT for the first time. Numerical experiments are carried out with a reduced CovType dataset for binary logistic regression over a variety of graphs to illustrate the above theoretical results.",

The approach is put in action in contexts where only partial information (namely the global energy stored in the physical system) is available. While the reconstruction of the microstructure is known to be an ill-posed problem, we show that the reconstruction of effective coefficients is possible and this even with only some coarse information. The strategy we present takes the form of a non-convex optimization problem. Homogenization theory provides elements for a rigorous foundation of the approach. Some algorithmic aspects are discussed in details. We provide a comprehensive set of numerical illustrations that demonstrate the practical interest of our strategy.

        "abstract": "We explore extreme value phenomena in spatial scale-free random graphs in a continuum setting based on a homogeneous Poisson point process in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Vertices carry i.i.d. weights $(W_x)$ and, conditionally on the vertex set and the weights, edges are present independently with probability $p_{xy}=1-\\exp\\{-λW_xW_y/|x-y|^α\\}$. Assuming Pareto-type weight tails with index $β>0$ and working in parameter ranges where degrees are almost surely finite, we study extremes and peaks over thresholds (POT) of edge lengths in a growing observation window. Our focus is the precise impact of the presence of (large) weights on edge lengths, captured through explicit scaling regimes and conditional POT limit theorems. Our main results identify a three-phase behavior governed by the weight-tail parameter $β$. We both deduce Fréchet-type limits for the maximum edge length itself and we reveal POT structures under a hub conditioning by proving a POT limit theorem. In the finite-mean regime $β>1$, the leading scaling agrees with the unweighted model up to a constant. By contrast, for $β\\le 1$ the weights have a macroscopic effect on extreme edge lengths: for $β< 1$ the scaling changes, and the borderline case $β=1$ exhibits additional logarithmic corrections. The proofs combine Stein-type Poisson approximation via a Palm-coupling approach with a refined treatment of the dependence created by the conditioning event.",

Symmetric solutions of this new equation present a remarkable factorization property which allows us to talk about their square roots. These square roots give a natural $q$-deformation of the Markov numbers that has not previously occurred in the literature. We call them mirror Markov numbers. We prove a characterization of mirror Markov numbers and discover a mutation rule, mirror mutation, to generate them all. We also prove a geometric realization of the corresponding mirror mutation on a once-punctured sphere with three orbifold points. Our mirror deformation leads to deformations of Fibonacci and Pell branches for which we give precise formulas. Furthermore, the deformed squared Markov equation specializes to many other very well known generalized Markov equations. We also obtain the super Markov numbers from a specialization of the deformed squared Markov numbers, which we use to prove a conjecture of Musiker.",

We give some new convergence results of the randomized global GMRES method for multiple linear systems. In the case where the coefficient matrix A is diagonalizable, we derive new upper bounds for the randomized Frobenius norm of the residual. In this paper, we study how to introduce matrix sketching in this algorithm. It allows us to reduce the dimension of the problem in one of the main steps of the algorithm. To validate the effectiveness and practicality of this approach, we conduct several numerical experiments, which demonstrate that our RGl-GMRES method is competitive with the GlGMRES method for solving large scale problems with multiple right-hand sides.",

By designing an appropriate consensus gain, the persistence of excitation of the regressor matrix is achieved, and thus, exponential convergence of a local Gradient Estimator (GE) is guaranteed. The framework facilitates its extension to switched network topologies, quantization, and the heterogeneous substitution of the GE with a Dynamic Regressor Extension and Mixing (DREM) estimator, which supports relaxed excitation requirements.",

The proposed MPC framework is designed to minimize deaths, achieve early disease eradication, and adhere to operational constraints. By incorporating an age-structured Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model with an additional term for vaccination, the MPC strategy dynamically adapts to the evolving epidemic state. A detailed proof of the asymptotic stability and recursive feasibility of the proposed MPC algorithm is provided. This ensures that the optimal cost at each step provides an upper bound on the minimal number obtainable of deaths at the end of the pandemic. Moreover, simulations demonstrate that the proposed MPC approach outperforms the decreasing age vaccination strategy adopted by the Belgian government during the first wave of vaccinations. The results highlight the potential of MPC-based vaccination strategies to reduce the total number of deaths, accelerate disease eradication, and optimize vaccine administration.",

Our main result is a monotonicity principle for the $\\log n$-order constant of either functional: if $f$ dominates $g$ in ``growth-ratio'' order (a variant of the hazard ratio order of probability densities) then the typical depth constant for $f$ is no larger than for $g$, i.e. stronger reinforcement yields a shallower tree. The proofs use a one-parameter interpolation together with a gauge normalisation that removes a global derivative term, reducing the sign to a weighted correlation inequality for monotone sequences. Equivalently, the results can be phrased as monotonicity theorems for the corresponding branching process functionals arising from the standard embedding of the PA tree into a Crump--Mode--Jagers process.",

These processes form a subclass of the Pearson diffusions which are defined as solutions of algebraic SDEs where the moments of the empirical distributions $μ_t^N:=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N δ_{X_{j,t}}$ can be computed inductively. This Pearson class also contains other well known diffusions like Dyson Brownian motions, and multivariate Laguerre and Jacobi processes After the time normalization $t\\mapsto t/β$, the SDEs above degenerate in the frozen case for $β=\\infty$ into ordinary differential equations which are related to pseudo-Jacobi polynomials. For $N\\to\\infty$ and under suitable initial conditions, the empirical distributions $μ_t^N$ converge weakly almost surely for $t>0$ to some limit which is independent from $β\\in[1,\\infty]$. For $a=-N, b=0$, we describe the limit explicitly via free convolutions. Moreover, if $a=cN$ for some $c>0$, the solutions of our SDEs converge for $t\\to\\infty$ to stationary distributions, which are Hua-Pickrell (or Cauchy) measures. We thus obtain connections between known results for the empirical distributions of these ensembles and the zeros of the pseudo-Jacobi polynomials. Furthermore, we derive a freezing central limit theorem for $β\\to\\infty$ for the Hua-Pickrell ensembles which is related to these zeros.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies consensus of discrete-time multi-agent systems under time-varying directed communication, state and input constraints using a distributed multi-step model predictive control (MPC) framework. Consensus is recast as stabilization of the agreement set, and a geometric viewpoint based on convex-hull invariance and strict interiority is adopted. Building on an existing geometric necessary and sufficient condition for agreement, we show that enforcing terminal inclusion in local neighbor convex hulls guarantees hull invariance but does not, in general, imply the strict relative-interior property required for convergence. An explicit counterexample demonstrates that strictness cannot be deduced from feasibility and contraction constraints alone. To resolve this issue without shrinking feasible sets or altering primary performance objectives, a lexicographic tie-breaking mechanism is introduced. Among optimal (or near-optimal) MPC solutions, the proposed secondary criterion selects trajectories maximizing an interiority measure with respect to the neighbor hull. It is shown that whenever an interior feasible terminal state exists, this selection rule enforces the strictness condition required for asymptotic consensus. Explicit horizon conditions are derived for single- and double-integrator agents with bounded inputs, ensuring feasibility and automatic existence of interior feasible terminal points. The resulting scheme provides a distributed and implementable route to consensus via finite-step set-Lyapunov contraction. Numerical simulations with distributed inter-process communication illustrate monotone diameter decay and report per-agent computational complexity.",

We prove that such solutions exist for arbitrary $N$, and that they are not unique. The proof consists of: 1) finding an approximate solution $φ_{\\mathrm{app}}$ with fast decaying error; 2) the use of backwards energy estimates in order to correct $φ_{\\mathrm{app}}$ to an exact solution. Extremality is used only in the second step. The methods of the linear case described above are then used to show the same results for semilinear equations where the nonlinearity satisfies the null condition, as well as to geometries describing the hyperbolic orbit of multiple extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes.",

As an application, we analyse a concrete family associated with the canonical line bundle and obtain non-existence criteria in terms of $p$-adic valuations; for $p=2$ this yields a simple numerical bound. The proofs rely on Chern class computations and divisibility properties of characteristic classes. The results leave open the question of existence in the range $4 \\le q < a(n)$.",

Almost all important classes of orbits and characters studied to the moment can be uniformly described as the orbits and characters associated with so-called orthogonal rook placements. In the paper, we construct a semi-direct decomposition for the corresponding irreducible characters in the spirit of the Mackey little group method. As a corollary, we present an explicit formula for the character corresponding to an orbit of maximal possible dimension.",

We compute the scheme-theoretic multiplicities of core Lagrangians, as well as the equivariant multiplicities of the very stable ones. Furthermore, we extend the notion of equivariant multiplicity to wobbly components and compute it for Hilbert schemes of two points. Inspired by Eisenstein series functor in Dolbeault Langlands correspondence, we propose that upward flows of very stable ideals are mirror dual to modified Procesi bundles, and justify this claim through numerical checks. Finally, we make some conjectures about extending this picture to wobbly upward flows.",

Assuming that $M^{n}$ satisfies suitable curvature constraints, we investigate rigidity results for such submanifolds. By combining a Simons-type formula for spacelike submanifolds with analytic techniques involving the Cheng-Yau modified operator $\\mathcal{L}$, we establish sharp inequalities relating the traceless second fundamental form and the gradient of the mean curvature. As applications, we obtain several characterization results showing that $M^{n}$ must be either totally umbilical or isoparametric. More precisely, we derive rigidity results under three distinct frameworks: via the Omori-Yau maximum principle, via the $\\mathcal{L}$-parabolicity of the underlying manifold, and under an integrability condition on the gradient of the mean curvature. These results generalize and unify known classification theorems for spacelike submanifolds satisfying linear Weingarten relations in semi-Riemannian ambient spaces.",

The arguably best-understood example is volume-maximization of convex bodies contained in other convex bodies, where the John decomposition describes$\\unicode{x2014}$and in the Euclidean case fully characterizes$\\unicode{x2014}$the optimal positions. For many other such problems, however, no general optimality conditions are known. To address this, we generalize an approach of O. B. Ader to obtain a John-type decomposition as a necessary condition for affinely-optimal containment chains, i.e., chains $r L_1 + c \\subseteq K \\subseteq R L_2 + d$ for convex bodies $K, L_1, L_2 \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$, translation vectors $c,d \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, and reals $r,R > 0$ such that the ratio $\\frac{R}{r}$ cannot be decreased by linearly transforming $K$. We again obtain sufficiency for optimality when ellipsoids are involved, and show how optimality conditions for various problems follow from our result. Our main applications concern the Banach-Mazur distance, where we provide necessary optimality conditions in the general case and a full characterization in the Euclidean case. Finally, we derive several consequences of these optimality conditions related to the Banach-Mazur distance to the Euclidean ball.",

In this paper, we express asymptotics for relative characters in the non-archimedean setting for $(\\mathrm{PGL}_2, \\mathrm{GL}_1)$. The key new innovation is that our method overcomes the stability hypothesis and allows for significant conductor dropping.",

Suppose that the total space carries a Nakano semi-positive vector bundle, which is equivariant with respect to this action. We consider the relative canonical bundle twisted by this bundle. Under this setting, we prove that the logarithm of the equivariant analytic torsion of the regular fibers for this coefficient admits an asymptotic expansion near the discriminant locus. The leading term is given by a logarithmic singularity, while the subdominant term is given by a loglog-type singularity. In the non-equivariant case, we provide a formula for the coefficient of the leading term in terms of an integral of characteristic classes associated with the semi-stable reduction of the family. To establish these results, we prove the existence of an asymptotic expansion for both the equivariant Quillen metrics and the $L^{2}$-metrics in the above setting. We also calculate the leading term of the fiber integral of the Bott-Chern classes associated with the degeneration.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of many of Antarctica's glaciers are modulated by a hydrological system at the base of the ice. Sedimentary basins beneath the ice bed contribute to the water budget in this hydrological system by discharging or taking up water. However, sedimentary basins are not included in most current models of ice dynamics, and little is known about their effect. In this paper we develop an idealised model of a glacier whose sliding is coupled to a subglacial hydrological system, which includes a sedimentary basin. We find that groundwater discharge (exfiltration) and recharge (infiltration) are controlled by the shape of the ice sheet and of the sedimentary basin, and that exfiltration promotes sliding whereas infiltration hinders it. Overall, the presence of a sedimentary basin leads to thicker and slower-flowing ice in the steady state. We also find that, when the ice sheet is undergoing retreating, groundwater exfiltration can lead to a positive feedback which accelerates this retreat. Our results shed light on the potential role and importance of Antarctic sedimentary basins, and how these might be incorporated into existing models of ice and subglacial hydrology.",

        "abstract": "Fluidic Shaping is a novel method for fabrication of optical components based on the equilibrium state of liquid volumes in neutral buoyancy, subjected to geometrical constraints. The underlying physics of this method is described by a highly nonlinear partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and an integral constraint. To date, useful solutions for such optical liquid surfaces could be obtained analytically only for the linearized equations and only on circular or elliptical domains. A numerical solution for the non-linear equation was suggested, but only for the axi-symmetric case. Such solutions are, however, insufficient as they do not capture the full range of optical surfaces. Arbitrary domains offer an important degree of freedom for creating complex optical surfaces, and the nonlinear terms are essential for high quality solutions. Moreover, in the context of optics, it is not sufficient to resolve the shape of the surface, and it is essential to obtain accurate solutions for its curvature, which governs its optical properties. We here present the theoretical foundation for the Fluidic Shaping method over arbitrary domains, and the development of a high order (quintic) finite element numerical solver, capable of accurately resolving the topography and curvature of liquid interfaces on arbitrary domains. The code is based on reduced quintic finite elements, which we have modified to capture curved boundaries. We compare the results against low order finite elements and non-deformed high order elements, demonstrating the importance of high order approximations of both the solution and the domain. We also show the usability of the code for the prediction of optical surfaces derived from complex boundary conditions.",

        "abstract": "The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant driver of interannual global climate variability and can lead to extreme weather events such as droughts or flooding. Recently, we have developed several statistical approaches for early ENSO forecasting, in particular, its El Niño phase. The climate network-based approach allows forecasting the onset of an El Niño event or its absence about 1 year ahead [1]. The complexity-based approach allows additionally to forecast the magnitude of an upcoming El Niño event in the calendar year before the onset [2]. Additionally, we have developed methods for forecasting the type (Eastern Pacific or Central Pacific) of an El Niño [3] and for probabilistic forecasting of La Niña and neutral events [4], also by the end of the calendar year before the event. Here we present the forecasts of these methods for 2026. The climate network and the complexity-based approach do not provide concurring signals for this year. The combined forecast indicates that a neutral event is more likely than an El Niño. If an El Niño develops in 2026, the complexity-based approach predicts a weaker event with a magnitude of $0.84\\pm0.36$°C.",

        "abstract": "We present and test a recursive regularised lattice Boltzmann method for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. The approach is based on a double-distribution formulation, in which the magnetic field is evolved using a standard BGK lattice Boltzmann scheme, while the fluid solver is enhanced through a Hermite-based recursive regularisation of the non-equilibrium moments. The method exploits a fourth-order Hermite expansion of the equilibrium distribution on the D2Q9 lattice, allowing higher-order isotropy to be retained while selectively filtering spurious non-hydrodynamic contributions. The regularisation procedure reconstructs the non-equilibrium distribution from physically consistent Hermite coefficients, avoiding explicit evaluation of velocity gradients. The resulting scheme preserves the correct incompressible MHD limit, improves numerical stability at low viscosities, and reduces lattice-dependent artefacts. The proposed formulation provides a robust and versatile framework for MHD simulations and offers a systematic route for extending regularised lattice Boltzmann methods to coupled multiphysics systems.",

        "abstract": "Highly stretched capillary jets produced by gravity are central to drop generation, micro-thread formation, and extensional-rheometry concepts. For Newtonian fluids, the transition from steady jetting to self-excited oscillations in a gravitationally stretched jet is predicted accurately by one-dimensional slender-jet equations that retain the exact interfacial curvature and admit a global eigenvalue analysis Rubio-Rubio et al. 2013. Separately, weakly viscoelastic jets governed by Oldroyd--B/Giesekus constitutive laws exhibit elastocapillary regimes and beads-on-a-string dynamics that are well captured by one-dimensional free-surface models Ardekani et al. 2010. Here we formulate a unified one-dimensional model for gravitationally stretched viscoelastic jets, combining full-curvature capillarity with a Giesekus stress closure, and we analyse its global linear stability on spatially developing base states. We first benchmark the Newtonian limit, reproducing marginal spectra and base-flow profiles, and then quantify how elasticity shifts the critical jetting--dripping boundary by tracking the leading global Hopf eigenpair across the rheological parametric space. For experimentally relevant moderate elasticity, characterised by order-unity Deborah numbers, polymeric tension modifies both the critical Weber number and the selected oscillation frequency, and endogeneity decompositions reveal that marginality results from a balance between capillary/kinematic contributions and an additional elastic-stress feedback pathway. To interpret and predict the onset mechanism, we compute wavemakers and receptivity/structural-sensitivity fields from direct--adjoint eigenfunctions, showing that viscoelasticity broadens the sensitivity region downstream while the adjoint remains strongly localized near the inlet, thereby identifying the near-nozzle region as the dominant receptive location.",

It refers to the prediction of a dissipative force acting on a moving object due to the quantum vacuum field. In this work, we investigate rotational quantum friction where a diatomic polar molecule rotates around its own center of mass in free space. We quantize the rotational motion and investigate the resulting dissipation due to spontaneous decay. We find in the Markovian regime that a friction torque $\\propto Ω^3$ persists even for zero temperature, and in agreement with the classical result in the limit of large rotational quantum number $l$. Within the non-Markovian short-time regime we find a friction $\\proptoΩ$.",

Our model fully accounts for the Coulomb interaction between all particles, except for the Coulomb repulsion between bound electrons which is replaced by effective potentials. This replacement overcomes the hurdle of artificial autoinization. In addition, the multielectron motion is treated on an equal footing with nuclear motion, that is, electrons and nuclei are both allowed to move at the same time. We focus on triple and double ionization as well as frustrated triple and double ionization. For these processes, we identify and explain the main features of the sum of the kinetic energies of the final ion fragments resulting from the break-up of O$_{2}^+$. We also describe a physical mechanism that underlies frustrated triple ionization.",

        "abstract": "Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the first relativistic quantum field theory, describes light-matter interactions at a fundamental level and is one of the pillars of the Standard Model (SM). Through the extraordinary precision of QED, the SM predicts the energy levels of simple systems such as the hydrogen atom with up to 13 significant digits, making hydrogen spectroscopy an ideal test bed. The consistency of physical constants extracted from different transitions in hydrogen using QED, such as the proton charge radius $r_\\mathrm{p}$, constitutes a test of the theory. However, values of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ from recent measurements of atomic hydrogen are partly discrepant with each other and with a more precise value from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen. This prevents a test of QED at the level of experimental uncertainties. Here we present a measurement of the 2S-6P transition in atomic hydrogen with sufficient precision to distinguish between the discrepant values of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ and enable rigorous testing of QED and the SM overall. Our result $ν^{}_{\\text{2S-6P}}$ = 730,690,248,610.79(48) kHz gives a value of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ = 0.8406(15) fm at least 2.5-fold more precise than from other atomic hydrogen determinations and in excellent agreement with the muonic value. The SM prediction of the transition frequency (730,690,248,610.79(23) kHz) is in excellent agreement with our result, testing the SM to 0.7 parts per trillion (ppt) and, specifically, bound-state QED corrections to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), their most precise test so far.",

        "abstract": "Density functional theory (DFT) has been critical towards our current atomistic understanding of catalysis on transition-metal surfaces. It has opened new paradigms in rational catalyst design, predicting fundamental properties, like the adsorption energy and reaction barriers, linked to catalytic performance. However, such applications depend sensitively on the predictive accuracy of DFT and achieving experimental-level reliability, so-called transition-metal chemical accuracy (13 kJ/mol), remains challenging for present density functional approximations (DFAs) or even methods beyond DFT. We introduce a new framework for designing DFAs tailored towards studying molecules adsorbed on transition-metal surfaces, building upon recent developments in non-self-consistent DFAs. We propose two functionals within this framework, demonstrating that transition-metal chemical accuracy can be achieved across a diverse set of 39 adsorption reactions while delivering consistent performance for 17 barrier heights. Moreover, we show that these non-self-consistent DFAs address qualitative failures that challenge current self-consistent DFAs, such as CO adsorption on Pt(111) and graphene on Ni(111). The resulting functionals are computationally practical and compatible with existing DFT codes, with scripts and workflows provided to use them. Looking ahead, this framework establishes a path toward developing more accurate and sophisticated DFAs for computational heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Anomalous local photocurrent generation via second-order nonlinear and thermoelectric responses is a signature of many topological semimetals. The emergence of these photocurrents is inherently linked to symmetry breaking and anisotropy of their crystal lattices. Studies of type-II Weyl semimetals of group C$_{2v}$ (WTe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, TaIrTe$_4$) have reported anomalous, nonlocal photocurrents localized to crystals edges or far from electrodes, which are highly dependent on the geometry of the material sample. While originally attributed to a nonlinear charge current response, it was recently shown that these currents could instead be attributed to the anisotropic Seebeck coefficients of the materials. Here, we confirm that anomalous photocurrents observed in TaIrTe$_4$ under either visible or far-infrared far-field illumination originate from the large transverse thermoelectric effect. We engineer the mutual orientation of crystal edges and electrodes as well as the thermal environment of TaIrTe$_4$ to control and amplify its spatial photocurrent response. We show that substrate engineering can locally enhance photocurrent. This framework of thermal device engineering can enable broadband photo detection schemes by leveraging spectral and spatial dependence of photocurrents for applications like wavefront sensing, beam positioning, and edge detection.",

        "abstract": "The accurate calculation of guided electromagnetic modes in optical nanofibres is critical for applications in nanophotonics, from quantum interfaces to vectorial light sensing. Standard textbook methods rely on solving a $4\\times4$ matrix eigenvalue problem to find the modal fields. While widely used, this approach has a subtle but significant flaw: the final determination of the field amplitudes requires finding the numerical null space of a theoretically singular matrix, an ill-conditioned problem that introduces large relative errors in the small but physically crucial longitudinal field components. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally more robust and efficient semi-analytical method. By starting from the foundational symmetries of the cylindrical waveguide and employing a judicious normalisation of the field amplitudes, we demonstrate that the problem can be analytically reduced to a much simpler $2\\times2$ system. This reformulation yields two decisive advantages: the dispersion relation is obtained numerically from a simple and well-behaved transcendental equation, and more importantly, the modal field amplitudes are subsequently determined \\emph{analytically}. Our approach completely bypasses the numerical null space calculation, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the full vectorial field structure. This method provides a powerful and reliable tool for the design and analysis of nanofibre-based devices, particularly for applications in chiral quantum optics and nanophotonics where precise knowledge of field polarisation and specifically of the longitudinal components is paramount.",

By employing an exact inversion of the PAW overlap operator, our approach maintains cubic scaling while naturally operating at the complete basis set limit defined by the PW cutoff. We benchmark this framework by calculating the equilibrium lattice constants and bulk moduli of C, BN, BP, and Si. Our analysis demonstrates that AFQMC systematically corrects the lack of long-range screening in MP2 and the missing higher-order exchange in RPA. We identify RPA as the optimal reference method due to the rapid convergence of the remaining short-range correlations with respect to supercell size. The resulting lattice constants exhibit a mean absolute relative error of 0.14 % relative to experiment, establishing the method as a rigorous benchmark tool for structural properties in condensed matter systems.",

This motivates the development of learning based surrogate models, which offer a promising route to accelerate these simulations while preserving physical fidelity. In this work, we study the Sedov Taylor shock propagation problem using a physics informed graph based surrogate model, Physics Informed MeshGraphNet (PhyMGN), designed for grid-based hydrodynamics. By incorporating weak physics constraints derived from the Euler equations using finite difference method, the model captures the self similar shock evolution and associated flow structures without explicitly solving the full hydrodynamic equations at each timestep. Comparing to the baseline MeshGraphNet model, PhyMGN is able to generalize beyond the training regime with a higher accuracy and preserves differentiability in parameter space while achieving a substantial reduction in computational cost relative to conventional numerical solvers.",

This requires continuous top-up injection and operation with a two-bunch injection scheme, injecting two 96 ns spaced bunches in a single injection cycle. An important input for tuning the injection beam is the position reading from a dedicated beam position monitor (BPM), located after the septum magnets, slightly upstream of where the injected and stored beams converge. Previously, the readout electronics used for these special BPMs were not capable of independent measurement of both bunches in the two-bunch injection mode and modification of the concerned devices and their firmware was not feasible. The opportunity was taken to develop a new readout device based on the AMD/Xilinx RF System on a Chip (RFSoC) platform with the goal of not only providing a sufficiently flexible and performant readout solution for the concerned BPMs, but also to evaluate and gain experience with the platform for beam monitor electronics applications. This paper is concerned with the details of this development as well as evaluation and operation of the developed device.",

        "abstract": "Laser wakefield theories rely on the laser envelope function, which is radially symmetric, and predict zero transverse momentum for the electrons along the propagation axis. Exact description of laser wakefields, beyond the envelope approximation, requires a more general formula for the Lorentz force acting on the electrons. Here we present a fundamental approach to express the transverse momentum of an electron crossing the laser pulse, and we show that an exact analytical formula can be derived for the non-zero transverse momentum of electrons initially lying along the axis of symmetry. The results outlined here shed light on the details of the electron motion inside an intense laser pulse and explain the strong wakefield asymmetry observed in simulations.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents experimental validation of the homogenized harmonic balance finite element method (HomHBFEM), which we have developed as a dedicated simulation technique for magnets with fast excitation cycles, in particular the fast corrector (FC) magnets for PETRA IV at DESY. The HomHBFEM allows efficient three-dimensional nonlinear eddy-current simulations of laminated magnets at elevated frequencies with a relatively coarse finite element (FE) mesh and without computationally expensive time-stepping. This is achieved by combining a frequency-domain-based homogenization technique with the harmonic balance FE method. The simulation results for the magnetic flux density along the axis of the FC magnets as a function of frequency and the resulting integrated transfer function (ITF) are compared to Hall probe and search coil measurements of the first prototype FC magnet for PETRA IV. A good agreement between simulated and measured ITFs is achieved for excitation frequencies from 10 Hz to 10 kHz.",

        "abstract": "Valley splitting in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells is a central parameter for silicon spin qubits and is commonly described with envelope-function and effective-mass theories. These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory.",

        "abstract": "Lensless digital holographic microscopy (LDHM) relies on interference between an unscattered reference wave and a weakly scattered object wave - an assumption that rapidly fails in turbid samples under multiple scattering. To overcome this limitation, we present near-infrared LDHM (NIR-LDHM), a in-line holographic platform that operates up to the silicon cutoff (~1100 nm) using a conventional board-level CMOS sensor designed for visible (VIS) imaging. Using tissue-mimicking milk scattering layers and calibrated resolution targets, we quantify reconstruction performance versus wavelength, scattering strength, and sample-sensor distance. NIR-LDHM maintains resolvable features through scattering layers up to ~1.4 mm, whereas visible regime fails to resolve features below ~350 um. Importantly, despite a detector quantum efficiency of only 0.19% at 1100 nm, robust reconstructions are obtained under low-photon-budget conditions. We further identify advantageous mechanism by which increasing the sample-sensor distance from ~3 to 12 mm improves lateral resolution by twofold under strong scattering. Finally, we demonstrate wide-field, label-free amplitude-phase imaging of uncleared mouse tissues, resolving internal structure in brain and liver slices up to ~250 um and ~60 um, respectively. By extending lensless complex-field microscopy into strongly scattering regimes with minimal hardware changes, this work has relevance to computational imaging through complex media and biophotonics.",

On the other hand, we argue that, because of the uncertainty principle, no local boundary condition can be defined for open quantum systems. For this reason plane waves or wave packet trains cannot be simulated on a finite numerical lattice with the usual procedures. We suggest a method that avoids these difficulties by using only a small numerical lattice and maintains the correspondence with the physical picture, in which the incident and scattered waves may be infinitely extended.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly applied in materials science, yet their predictive power is often constrained by data scarcity. Here, we show that accurate predictions can be achieved, even with a limited number of training examples, provided the dataset is compact and and grounded in physically relevant quantities. By combining density functional theory calculations with a machine-learning framework, we construct accurate descriptor-based models to predict the formation energies of doped lepidocrocite TiO$_2$ monolayers. The predictive accuracy of machine-learning models was first evaluated for single-dopant Pt configurations, demonstrating that the selected structural and chemical descriptors reliably capture the key factors governing dopant stability. Chemical transferability is then examined by extending the dataset to include Ag-doped configurations. Predictive accuracy improved systematically as additional Ag-doped data points were included in the training, while the performance of Pt remains robust. These results highlight the potential of small and well-curated datasets combined with physically informed descriptors to enable not only accurate but also chemically transferable machine-learning-driven screening in doped TiO$_2$ monolayer.",

A crucial and often underestimated issue with APT is its accuracy in compositional measurements of non-metallic systems. This work introduces the principles of APT as an experimental technique, recalling the aspects potentially leading to compositional biases and underlining in particular the role of the surface electric field in governing the different physical-chemical phenomena that enable the measurement. It reviews the possible mechanisms of specific losses, as well as the methods for assessing a compositional bias and proposing possible correction methods. Finally, it establishes a state of the art on compositional biases in APT of non-metallic materials, on the basis of which it will be possible to conclude on specific recommendations for best practices, and the perspective of application of APT to new materials.",

Starting from the Dirac equation and using controlled spinless and paraxial approximations, we show that the transverse envelope obeys an effective nonstationary Schrödinger equation governed by a Caldirola--Kanai Hamiltonian. The longitudinal energy gain or loss encoded in $f(z)=[E_0-V(z)]^2-m^2$ generates an effective gain or damping rate $\\widetildeγ(z)=\\partial_z f(z)/[2f(z)]$ and a $z$-dependent oscillator frequency $\\widetildeω(z)=p_0Ω(z)/\\sqrt{f(z)}$. Exploiting the Ermakov mapping (unitary equivalence of Caldirola--Kanai systems), we obtain a closed-form propagated twisted wave function by transforming the stationary Landau basis. The transverse evolution is controlled by a single scaling function $b(z)$ that satisfies a generalized Ermakov--Pinney equation with coefficients determined by $E_z(z)$ and $B_z(z)$. In the limiting cases of uniform acceleration with $B_z=0$ and of solenoid focusing with negligible acceleration, our solution reduces to previously known analytic results, providing a direct bridge to established models.",

To address this, we propose and numerically demonstrate a method for designing robust Raman pulses using the Krotov quantum optimal control algorithm. We establish a theoretical model for the atom-laser interaction and detail the implementation of the Krotov method to optimize the temporal shape of the pulse's amplitude and phase. Numerical simulations indicate that, compared to standard pulses, the optimized pulses maintain high atomic manipulation fidelity over an extended range of laser frequency detunings and intensity fluctuations. Furthermore, in simulations of a full interferometer sequence, this robustness translates to a significant enhancement in the final fringe contrast under a systematic detuning. This work demonstrates that quantum optimal control is a promising pathway for suppressing experimental noise and improving the signal-to-noise ratio and precision of next-generation atomic sensors.",

        "abstract": "Dielectric waveguide (DWG) interconnects frequently utilize multimode waveguides due to their low dispersion in the fundamental mode. However, these links are more vulnerable to cross-modal coupling that significantly impacts their overall performance. This study presents a technique aimed at minimizing the coupling of energy into higher-order modes within weakly coupled rectangular dielectric waveguides that are excited by a linear taper. The approach involves wrapping the waveguide with a material of a higher dielectric constant than both the core and the cladding of the waveguide. The added material significantly improves the modal confinement factor of the fundamental mode to the core, leading to a much smaller coupling to the parasitic higher-order cladding modes. The new waveguide with the additional material cladding is analyzed, and semi-analytical approximate expressions are derived to predict the mode profiles and cutoffs. Design equations are given to choose the thickness of the wrapping material. The waveguide is fabricated and compared against a similar cross-section waveguide without the additional wrapping material. Unlike the unwrapped waveguide, the group delay (GD) results of the proposed (wrapped) waveguide closely match the EM-simulated GD of the fundamental mode, confirming the significant isolation of higher-order modes. The measured GD of the proposed DWG is 50 ps/m, while the expected fundamental mode GD from EM simulations is 35 ps/m. On the contrary, the unwrapped DWG shows a measured GD of 200 ps/m with significant oscillations, while the expected fundamental mode GD from EM simulations is 25 ps/m, demonstrating that wrapping the waveguide significantly improves the GD by reducing the higher-order mode propagation.",

        "abstract": "Microscale transport often relies on ubiquitous yet intrinsically random thermal fluctuations. Understanding how such fluctuations can be biased into directed motion has long been a central theme of nonequilibrium physics. Here, we introduce self-viscophoresis, a mechanism of autonomous motion based on the rectification of thermal fluctuations in a self-generated nonequilibrium viscosity field. Asymmetric colloidal particles dispersed in a thermoresponsive polymer solution induce local heating under uniform illumination, producing a spatially asymmetric viscosity profile around the particle and resulting in persistent directed motion. To elucidate the physical origin of this behavior, we develop a minimal Langevin model coupling isotropic thermal fluctuations to a dynamically updating temperature-viscosity field. The model shows that viscosity asymmetry anisotropically damps stochastic dynamics, effectively biasing thermal fluctuations into a net drift. It thus reproduces the observed directed motion without invoking deterministic propulsion terms associated with effective potentials or environmental fluid flows. Our results distinguish self-viscophoresis from conventional self-propulsion mechanisms and establish it as a general framework enabling reversible control of both the direction and dimensionality of motion.",

Finite-energy grid states are generated deterministically using coherently driven entangled nonlinear biphoton sources that produce single-photon frequency-comb supermodes. An optical-frequency-comb reference anchors the time--frequency phase space and enforces commuting displacement stabilizers directly at the hardware level, continuously defining the logical subspace. Timing jitter, spectral drift, and phase noise map naturally onto Gaussian displacement errors within this lattice, yielding intrinsic correctability inside a stabilizer cell. Logical operations correspond to experimentally accessible phase and delay controls, enabling deterministic state preparation and manipulation. Building on the modal time--frequency GKP framework, we identify a concrete pathway toward active syndrome extraction and deterministic displacement recovery using ancillary grid states and interferometric time--frequency measurements. These primitives establish a hardware-compatible route for integrating the time--frequency GKP logical layer into erasure-aware and fusion-based fault-tolerant photonic architectures.",

Remodeling in the extracellular matrix's structural fibers leads to insight into the development of diseases such as cancer, fibrosis and carcinoma. While standard tissues visualization in the ECM involves multiple lengthy histopathological staining protocols, Mueller matrix-based polarimetry provides label-free tissue slices' microstructural information and optical properties. This work aims to identify three types of fiber tissues commonly found in the ECM of gastrointestinal tissue specimens by analyzing their polarization properties. To address decomposition methods' reliance on restrictive hypotheses and inability with an individual polarization-based parameter to determine the nature of a given biological tissue; this study employs Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method to offer greater discriminative power and flexibility. Subsequently, polarization-based features will be extracted and compared between fiber regions statistically to discern potential diagnostic differences. By providing colorized images, this work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of distinguishing different fibers with polarization approach, offering insights for future clinical development while complementing existing staining methods for pathological tissue specimens.",

        "abstract": "Molecular and polymeric crystals show a wide range of functional properties that arise from the interplay between the atomic-scale structure of their constituent molecules and the organization of these molecules within the crystal lattice at macroscopic length scales. X-ray diffraction can provide structural information at these disparate length scales, but usually only through experiments that address one or the other of molecular (or unit-cell) structure versus crystal structure. Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal. The approach may assist in studies such as diffusion and binding in MOFS, protein-drug binding, crystal growth, and the mechanical responses of photo-reactive or thermally driven dynamic crystals.",

Here we show that a large class of potentially dangerous tipping originates at the atomistic scale in such edge AI due to competition for the machinery's attention. This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings.",

Notably, it achieves exceptional performance with gravimetric and volumetric uptakes of 18.0 wt\\% and 72.6 g \\ce{H2} L$^{-1}$ at 298 K and 700 bar. The material exhibits optimal binding energies (15--20 kJ$\\cdot$mol$^{-1}$) ensuring both high storage capacity and deliverable hydrogen under practical conditions. This work establishes ferrocene functionalization as a cost-effective alternative to precious metal incorporation in COFs.",

        "abstract": "Phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of hexagonal ice (Ih) along [0001] sometimes shows a honeycomb-like pattern, often interpreted as individual oxygen columns in single crystals. Here, we show that this pattern commonly arises from intrinsic basal stacking faults instead. A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of (2/3a + 1/3b), produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [0001] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length. These findings highlight the defect tolerance of ice's molecular packing and clarify the structural relationships among hexagonal, stacking-disordered, and cubic ice phases. This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state.",

Assessing its implications from a spatial and material perspective requires an understanding of the core drivers of a distribution grid configuration. Our model samples substation locations using a non-linear relationship with population density and constructs the network applying the Kruskal algorithm. This streamlined approach generates realistic grid structures at the local scale and provides accurate estimates of the total network length at the national scale. Using highly granular population data, this local model reveals a profound connection between population spread and distribution grid, which appears to persist at the global level. Potentially driven by the emergent properties of population scaling laws, the full network characteristics appear to be well described by multivariate power laws on aggregated population and area. Validated across 35 countries, these results provide new multi-scale tools for characterizing electrical infrastructure and reveal key determinants of distribution grid extent.",

        "abstract": "Optoacoustic imaging technologies still rely on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) as the preferred method for essential signal conditioning operations. The long-standing success of the DFT is largely due to the limited generalizability of data-driven alternatives (e.g., deep neural networks) and the inconsistent accuracy of other analytical transforms (e.g., wavelet transforms). However, the DFT is a 'general-purpose' algorithm whose building blocks, when considered individually, are not directly related to the physics of optoacoustic signal generation. As a result, its accuracy can be limited. Moreover, the computational complexity of its modern algorithmic form imposes a hard limit on execution speed. This limitation may be particularly pronounced in advanced spectral systems that produce large data sets, preventing their adoption. Importantly, optoacoustic imaging technologies are increasingly impacting biological research while standing on the brink of widespread clinical adoption. We have devised a new transform whose building blocks are directly inspired by the physics of optoacoustic signal generation. We have compared its performance with the DFT and other classical transforms on typical signal processing tasks using both simulations and experimental data sets. Our results indicate that the proposed transform not only establishes a new lower bound in computational complexity relative to the DFT, but also strongly outperforms the classical transforms for basic signal processing operations in terms of accuracy metrics. We expect our new transform to catalyze the general adoption of optoacoustic methods.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge in open quantum dynamics is the inclusion of Matsubara-decay terms in the memory kernel, which arise from the quantum-Boltzmann delocalisation of the bath modes. This delocalisation can be quantified by the radius of gyration squared ${\\mathcal R}^2(ω)$ of the imaginary-time Feynman paths of the bath modes as a function of the frequency $ω$. In a Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) calculation with a Debye--Drude spectral density, ${\\mathcal R}^2(ω)$ is the only quantity that is treated approximately (assuming convergence with respect to hierarchy depth). Here, we show that the well-known Ishizaki--Tanimura correction is equivalent to separating smooth from `Brownian' contributions to ${\\mathcal R}^2(ω)$, and that modifying the correction leads to a more efficient HEOM in the case of fast baths. We also develop a simple `A4' adaptation of the `AAA' (Adaptive Antoulas--Anderson) algorithm in order to fit ${\\mathcal R}^2(ω)$ to a sum over poles, which results in an extremely efficient implementation of the standard HEOM method at low temperatures.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to investigate the use of dynamic MRI to assess abdominal wall biomechanics before and after hernia surgery, considering that such evaluations can enhance our understanding of physiopathology and contribute to reducing recurrence rates. Methods: Patients were assessed using dynamic MRI in axial and sagittal planes while performing exercises (breathing, coughing, Valsalva) before and after their abdominal hernia surgery with mesh placement. Rectus and lateral muscles, linea alba, viscera area, defect dimensions and hernia sac were contoured with semi-automatic process to quantify the abdominal wall biomechanical temporal modifications. Results: This study enrolled 11 patients. During coughing, the axial area of the hernia sac increased by 128.4 $\\pm$ 199.2%. The sac increased similarly in axial and sagittal planes during Valsalva. Post-surgical evaluations showed a 26% reduction in inter-recti distance and a lengthening of all muscles (p $\\le$ 0.05). The post-operative rectus abdominis thickness change was negatively correlated with defect width during breathing (p $\\le$ 0.05). The largest change in linea alba displacement was observed in the surgical site (p = 0.07). Post-operatively, lateral muscles had a larger inward displacement during Valsalva (p $\\le$ 0.05). Rectus abdominis had a larger outward displacement during breathing (p = 0.09), reduced with the mesh size (p $\\le$ 0.05). A large inter-individual variability was observed. Conclusion: Using a semi-automatic methodology, an in-depth analysis of the biomechanics of the abdominal wall was conducted, highlighting the importance of a patient-specific assessment. A broader study and consideration of recurrence would subsequently complete this methodological work.",

        "abstract": "Coarse-grained molecular dynamics often sacrifices accuracy and transferability for computational efficiency, but the use of machine learned potentials is helping coarse-grained models attain performance on par with atomistic molecular dynamics. Nevertheless, developing representations of the coarse-grained potential energy surface faces severe scaling challenges due to the extreme data demands of widely used \"bottom-up\" coarse-graining objectives. In this work, we show that mean force matching, a strategy for training thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained models, requires 50x fewer training samples and 87% less total atomistic simulation time, while obtaining better accuracy on the potential of mean force for unseen proteins compared to other commonly used objectives. By systematically removing noise from the objective function, we demonstrate that it is possible to scale machine learning architectures for coarse-graining, enabling highly accurate and transferable models. We show the advantages of mean force matching both theoretically and through exhaustive benchmarking using thermodynamic consistency as the primary metric of accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Several applications of medical ultrasound can benefit from a larger imaging field of view (FOV). This study is aimed at increasing the FOV of linear array probes by increasing the element size rather than the element count. To investigate larger FOV, this study used coupled elements to imitate a larger element size. The effects of coupling on array beam patterns are examined with Fourier transforms of elements. The effects of coupling on resolution, contrast, and speckle signal-to-noise ratio are examined through phantom images and in-vivo images of a rabbit tumor reconstructed with plane-wave compounding. Furthermore, a positioning system was used to acquire data from a virtual large aperture with 120 mm FOV and 128 elements, collected in sections with a single probe. This study also investigates the Null Subtraction Imaging (NSI), Sign Coherence Factor (SCF), and Minimum Variance (MV) beamformers for regaining resolution lost by an increased F-number with large elements. The MV beamformer, while the most computationally expensive, was best for improving resolution without increasing speckle variance, decreasing Full-Width at Half-Max (FWHM) estimates of wire targets from 0.78 mm with DAS on a 2.5 wavelength element size to 0.54 mm with MV on a 5 wavelength element size.",

We investigate DM production in a PBH-dominated cosmological framework, including contributions from PBH evaporation, gravitational production, and thermal freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms, and determine the regions consistent with the observed DM relic abundance. We find that thermal freeze-in can compensate for the underabundance of PBH-sourced DM, while indirect detection remains largely insensitive due to the feeble interaction strength, making future GW observatories such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope (ET) unique probes of this scenario. For freeze-out DM, indirect detection experiments constrain regions with relatively large annihilation cross-sections, whereas GW observations probe complementary regions with heavier DM masses and smaller interaction strengths. Consequently, the same DM parameter space cannot be simultaneously probed by both indirect detection searches and GW missions. These results establish GW observations as a powerful and independent probe of DM production in PBH-dominated cosmologies, opening a new observational window into DM properties and the thermal history of the pre-BBN Universe.",

        "abstract": "Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of radio sources characterized by long spin periods ($P_{\\text{spin}}>10^3$ s) and highly variable radio emission. While known magnetars are relatively young ($τ<10^5$ yrs) with spin periods clustered between $1-10$ sec, it has been proposed that LPTs may be linked to a missing population of older magnetars. In this paper, we present an extensive parametric analysis of isolated magnetar spin evolution using various propeller spin-down models. In general, at higher initial magnetar B-fields ($B_0>\\sim10^{15}$ G) and larger ambient densities ($n_0>\\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$), magnetars will transition to the propeller phase earlier, and they start accreting gas from the ISM or molecular clouds after $τ\\sim10^8$ yrs. We found that a transition from the pulsar to the propeller phase is required to reach the observed LPT period range of $P>10^3$ s. More specifically, our population synthesis study based on Monte-Carlo simulations shows that two propeller models can account for most of the observed LPT periods ($P\\sim1-400$ [min]) and their period derivative constraints ($\\dot{P}<10^{-9}$ s s$^{-1}$). Our spin-down models predict that (1) nearby radio-quiet neutron stars with the estimated dipole $B$-field range of $B\\sim(1-5)\\times10^{13}$ G will transition to the propeller phase eventually after $τ>\\sim10^7$ yrs; (2) thermal X-ray emission from accretion-phase magnetars becomes too faint for detection after traveling ($d>\\sim10$ kpc) from their birth places; (3) sporadic radio outbursts observed from LPTs may not be explained by regular radio pulsar and magnetar emission mechanisms that operate during the propeller phase.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational waves (GWs) produced during first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early universe provide a powerful probe of nonstandard cosmological histories. We study GW production from a FOPT ending a kination-dominated epoch in the Kination-Induced Big Bang scenario, in which a period of kination domination terminates through a phase transition that reheats the universe into radiation domination. A rolling scalar field drives the kination epoch. In the specific model we consider, its derivative coupling to a second scalar (tunneling field) dynamically traps the latter in a false vacuum, with the phase transition triggered as the kination field slows due to Hubble friction. We compute the resulting stochastic GW background from bubble nucleation and collisions, presenting analytic estimates and numerical results for the peak amplitude and frequency. In all cases we find an upper bound $Ω_{\\rm GW} h^2\\lesssim 2\\times10^{-7}$ from the bubble percolation condition. In the case where the false vacuum energy dominates at the transition (yet the kination field drives the FOPT), we find $Ω_{\\rm GW}h^2\\gtrsim 10^{-12}$. We further find that the Hubble scale during the phase transition across a broad set of model parameters is bounded by $\\mathscr{O}(10^{-13})M^2/M_{\\rm Pl}\\lesssim H_* \\lesssim \\mathscr{O}(0.1)M^2/M_{\\rm Pl}$, where $M$ is the mass-scale controlling the strength of the interaction between the kination and tunneling fields. The predicted signal spans frequencies from nHz to MHz, allowing the model to explain the signal reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments and to be constrained or probed by interferometers such as LISA, Advanced LIGO, Cosmic Explorer, and BBO. Interestingly, a FOPT can occur even if the bare tunneling potential has a single minimum, as metastability is generated dynamically by the coupling between the tunneling and the kination field.",

However, these elevation products were generated with a proprietary pipeline and have not been publicly released. We present a 0.30 m/pixel digital elevation model (DEM) of the Chandrayaan-3 Vikram landing site using a fully open workflow based on ISIS, the Ames Stereo Pipeline, and ALE, achieving sub-meter resolution comparable to mission-reported products. The reconstruction covers 2.18 x 2.24 km with 91.2% valid pixel coverage, 8.1 cm median triangulation error, and 40-50 cm relative vertical precision. The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover are individually resolved. Geodetic alignment to an LROC NAC stereo DEM achieves approximately 30 m horizontal accuracy; pixel-wise validation at 3 m resolution confirms negligible vertical bias (median dz = +0.28 m) and robust dispersion (NMAD = 2.88 m). Stable OHRC stereo convergence requires Community Sensor Model (CSM) camera models; the legacy ISIS camera model failed across two independent sites. At 0.30 m, these DEMs complement LROC NAC DTMs (approximately 1 m), resolving sub-meter hazards below the NAC detection threshold. Applied to the extensive OHRC south polar archive, this methodology provides independent capability for hazard mapping and landing site analysis for upcoming missions including Chandrayaan-4, LUPEX, and Artemis.",

We found that the HeII emission line formation region is not eclipsed and is significantly larger than both the donor star and the photosphere of the supercritical accretion disk. The HeII radial velocity curve was found to be independent of the precessional phase and inconsistent with the photometric curve. These findings suggest that the HeII line does not reflect the orbital motion of the compact object. Therefore, spectroscopic estimates of the masses of the components in SS433 based on the HeII emission line can be unrealistic.",

        "abstract": "Spectral distortion anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a new probe of the early Universe that can be accessed using traditional CMB imaging techniques. It is possible to compute the creation and evolution of anisotropic signals for various scenarios using the frequency hierarchy method recently developed for CosmoTherm. However, the current treatment is not perfect and some approximations had to be made. Here, we carefully construct a modified form for the evolution equations that has the full equilibrium solutions built into the formulation. We improve the formalism to account for i) additional stimulated scattering effects, ii) kinematic corrections to the thermalization terms, iii) corrections to the standard perturbation variables and iv) direct photon sources. These effect could not be captured with the original formulation of the frequency hierarchy method but are indeed important for cleanly separating real distortions from temperature signals. However, we show that previous results are not altered significantly when compared to the improved formulation presented here. As a new worked example, which could indeed not be treated before, we also illustrate how possible changes in the temperature-redshift relation would create spectral distortion anisotropies in the pre-recombination era. The theoretical methods presented here are also an important step towards being able to consistently predict the CMB spectral distortion anisotropies in photon-dark photon and photon-axion conversion scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The results of interferometric observations of the star-forming region S255IR in the frequency range 210--250 GHz are presented. The observations were carried out with the antenna array SMA (Hawaii, USA). Fifty-three molecules were detected, including complex organic molecules (COMs) such as CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, and many others. Typical rotational temperatures in the hot core SMA1 fall in the range 100--200 K. Optical depths in the lines of methanol and some other molecules in the cores SMA1 and SMA2 were estimated. In SMA1, the optical depth of one of the strongest methanol lines, $5_{-1}-4_{-1}E$, proved to be $23.8 \\pm 1.5$. Based on this value, one can assume that the lines of other oxygen-containing COMs, such as CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, which are typically much less abundant in hot cores than methanol, are optically thin in SMA1. Most of the detected molecules can be roughly divided into two groups. The molecules of the first group emit exclusively toward the hot core SMA1, while some or all lines of the molecules of the second group, in addition to SMA1, can be seen toward a ring-like structure to the west of SMA1. This structure is most likely associated with the walls of a cavity formed by high-velocity outflows driven by young stellar objects (YSOs) in molecular cores SMA1, SMA2, and possibly SMA3. The gas temperature and density in the cavity walls were estimated using methanol lines. The temperature was found to be about 50--60 K, and the density about $10^7-10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The column density of methanol near the brightness peaks in the lines of this molecule is about $5\\times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$. The column densities of other COMs in the ring-like structure will be determined in future studies with increased sensitivity achieved by spectral line stacking.",

        "abstract": "The [C/N]-age relation has become a powerful tool for reconstructing the formation history of the Milky Way (MW), providing the largest age sample for field giant stars. However, at metallicities below [Fe/H] $< -0.5$, stellar surfaces are altered by a poorly understood process known as extra mixing, which modifies [C/N] in a mass- and metallicity-dependent manner. This effect complicates the application of the traditional [C/N]-age relation in metal-poor regimes. Within the MW, constraining the mass dependence of extra mixing is particularly challenging because stars at [Fe/H] $< -0.5$ are predominantly old and therefore low-mass, leading to strong degeneracies between mass and metallicity. In this work, we explore the potential of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to disentangle these effects and constrain extra mixing as a function of age and metallicity. By comparing empirical corrections calibrated in the MW with predictions from thermohaline mixing models, we isolate the mass dependence of extra mixing in the MCs down to [Fe/H] $\\sim-0.7$. We find that the empirical calibration performs well for lower-mass stars ($< 1.25$ $M_{\\odot}$), while theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed mass dependence down to $\\sim$ 1.25 $M_{\\odot}$. We further present the first observational evidence that extra mixing becomes ineffective above $\\sim$ 1.8 $M_{\\odot}$ at [Fe/H] $\\sim -0.7$. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of deriving [C/N]-based ages for individual stars in external galaxies. Future observations targeting higher-$\\log g$ or fainter stars in the MCs will provide stronger constraints on extra-mixing processes and enable the calibration of [C/N]-age relation that can be applied to low-metallicity individual stars in the MW or external galaxies.",

        "abstract": "The origin of the red colouration in Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) is a long-standing question in planetary science. While several candidate chromophores have been proposed, no clear conclusions have been reached regarding its nature, evolution, or relationship to atmospheric dynamics. In this work, we perform microphysical simulations of the reddish haze over the GRS and quantify the production rates and timescales required to sustain it. Matching the previously reported chromophore column mass and effective radius in the GRS requires column-integrated injection fluxes in the range $1\\times10^{-12}$-$7\\times10^{-12}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, under low upwelling velocities in the upper troposphere ($v_{\\mathrm{trop}}\\lesssim 1.5\\times10^{-4}$ m s$^{-1}$) and particle charges of at least 20 electrons per $μ$m. Such rates exceed the mass flux that standard photochemical models of Jupiter currently supply via NH$_3$-C$_2$H$_2$ photochemistry at 0.1-0.2 bar, the most popular chromophore pathway in recent literature. We find a lower limit of 7 years on the haze formation time. We also assess commonly used size and vertical distribution parameterisations for the chromophore haze, finding that eddy diffusion prevents the long-term confinement of a thin layer and that the extinction is dominated by particles that can be represented by a single log-normal size distribution.",

        "abstract": "TiO plays an important role in determining the atmospheric structure of M-type stars and in shaping the visual part of their spectra. We compute synthetic spectra for late-type M giants and identify systematic discrepancies in the wavelength range 5810-5850 A. To investigate the origin of these discrepancies, we analyse experimental TiO absorption cross-sections. We report the detection of a molecular band of the singlet system $^{1}Π$-a$^{1}Δ$ of the TiO, with an R-head located at 5814.8 A, overlapping the 1-3 band of the C$^3Δ$-X$^3Δ$ system. The lower state of the band is identified as the a$^1Δ$ v\"=0 state, while the upper state is most likely the $^1Π$ in its ground vibrational state. The empirical band intensity is derived by comparing the relative strengths of neighbouring bands from the C$^3Δ$-X$^3Δ$ and B$^3Π$-X$^3Δ$ systems in the experimental cross-section. The band intensity is further validated by synthetic spectrum calculations for the late-type giant 30 Her (M6 III) and comparison with its observed spectrum from the MELCHIORS library. The newly identified band is sufficiently strong to affect the flux distribution in the spectra of cool stars.",

The Chandra data are sufficient to characterize the morphology of this cluster and constrain the geometrically deprojected temperature in 2 spatial bins out to $r_{2500}$, revealing a dynamically relaxed system whose temperature drops to $kT = 1.8\\pm0.6$ keV in the inner $\\sim40$kpc. Within this same inner radius, the surface brightness and density of the ICM is sharply peaked, and the cooling time falls to $t_\\mathrm{cool}=280^{+150}_{-120}$ Myr. A novel forward-modeling analysis of the XMM data extends imaging and spectroscopic measurements of this system out to $r_{500}$, constraining the redshift to $z=1.50\\pm0.03$, with a mean temperature of $kT = 7.3\\pm1.1$ keV and an emission-weighted mean metallicity of $Z/Z_\\odot = 0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.25}$. We also utilize the limited optical/IR photometric coverage of the cluster to characterize the properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), which is coincident with the X-ray peak. Despite the high redshift and strong cool core, the BCG exhibits no signs of recent or ongoing star formation, suggesting AGN feedback has been acting persistently to stem star formation since $z\\sim 2.5$. These measurements identify ACT-CL J0123.5$-$0428 as the highest redshift, dynamically relaxed, cool core galaxy cluster discovered to date, making it a premier target for future astrophysical and cosmological studies.",

        "abstract": "NGC 4631 X-8 is an ultraluminous X-ray pulsar (ULXP) having a spin period of about 9.7 s, discovered using XMM-Newton observations in 2025. The pulsar is known to show one of the largest spin-up rates ($\\sim 9.6 \\times 10^{-8}$ s s$^{-1}$) among the ULXP population. We explore the surface magnetic field of the neutron star in this source using different models, and find that the inferred magnetic field lies in the range of about $0.3-2 \\times 10^{14}$G. We study the long-term magnetic field and spin period evolution of the pulsar assuming steady accretion using prevalent theoretical mechanisms and find that the pulsar will evolve to become a millisecond pulsar having decayed magnetic field of about $\\sim 10^{9}$G in about a million years. The scenario of the formation of a millisecond pulsar is also probed using an estimate of the super-Eddington duty cycle of about 14% from the literature, which suggests that the neutron star would accrete sufficient matter to become a recycled millisecond pulsar. Exploring the magnetic field as well as the spin period evolution properties of ULXPs may enable us to understand the poorly understood evolutionary features of ULXPs, shed light on one of the pathways of millisecond pulsar formation and also help us to understand transient super-Eddington accretion phases in newborn magnetars, which are believed to power energetic events such as long gamma-ray bursts and Type I superluminous supernovae.",

Compared to isolated galaxies, close pairs exhibit a significantly reduced bar fraction at projected separations within 25 kpc. This reduction is driven almost entirely by systems showing clear merger or disturbance signatures, indicating that tidal interactions suppress bars. The decline is dominated by a decrease in weak bars, while the fraction of strong bars remains largely unchanged. Bar suppression is primarily associated with major mergers and is strongest in massive host galaxies. A weaker but statistically significant suppression is detected in minor mergers only for massive galaxies with small bulges. In contrast, no significant dependence of bar suppression on the relative orientation between pair members is found. These findings provide observational evidence that tidal perturbations in major mergers play a key role in regulating bar evolution.",

        "abstract": "Searches for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds from first-order phase transitions offer a powerful probe of hidden sectors, but quantitative predictions in gauge theories are obstructed by the gauge dependence of the finite-temperature effective potential and the associated tunneling action. We study a minimal gauged $U(1)$ dark sector containing a dark Higgs and a dark photon, optionally supplemented by a vectorlike dark fermion, coupled to the Standard Model through Higgs portal or kinetic mixing. Using the Nielsen identity together with a controlled derivative expansion and power counting, we construct a gauge-independent effective action in the high- and low-temperature limits, enabling model-intrinsic nucleation dynamics and robust gravitational wave predictions. We perform dedicated Monte Carlo scans in both limits and map viable microscopic parameters to detector-facing peak frequencies and amplitudes, spanning bands relevant to pulsar timing arrays and planned space-based interferometers. In our scans, supercooled transitions typically produce the strongest signals, whereas parametrically high-temperature transitions are comparatively rare and tend to be weak. We further connect the phase transition phenomenology to viable dark matter candidates within the same minimal field content, providing benchmark targets for dark photon dark matter and dark fermion dark matter, and highlighting their complementarity with gravitational wave observables. Overall, our results provide an end-to-end, gauge-independent pipeline from a minimal hidden sector Lagrangian to gravitational wave spectra and cosmologically viable dark matter benchmarks, yielding the most reliable and concrete predictions to date for a minimal gauged $U(1)$ dark sector.",

        "abstract": "It has long been suspected that black hole accretion-outflow coupling is invariant from the stellar to supermassive scales. Stellar mass black hole accretion flows are known to launch jets and outflows as they transition through critical accretion rate thresholds, with values well constrained observationally owing to their short evolutionary timescales. In contrast, accretion flows in typical supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems (those in active galactic nuclei) evolve over thousands of years, making the critical transitions at which jets are launched impossible to constrain in individual systems. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide the unique opportunity to witness the birth and evolution of an accretion flow onto a SMBH which evolves on timescales of years. Here we show that TDEs launch outflows during a super-Eddington accretion phase and a second, physically distinct outflow, at a critical accretion rate of $L_{\\rm crit} \\approx0.02$ $L_{\\rm Edd}$, the same as the critical accretion rate for state transitions observed in accreting stellar mass black holes. This work naturally explains the mechanism, observed properties, and detection rate for prompt and delayed outflows observed in TDEs, which until now have been open problems. More broadly, we demonstrate that SMBHs exhibit the same accretion-outflow coupling as stellar mass black holes and that the critical low accretion rate threshold for jet formation in black holes is scale invariant.",

        "abstract": "The angular, harmonic cross-correlation between gravitational wave (GW) events and galaxy catalogues contains rich information on the large-scale structure and the origin of compact binary mergers. In this work, we study how uncertainties in the binary formation channel affect the predicted cross-correlation signal for both current-generation and next-generation networks of detectors. We generate five mock GW catalogues for which we vary the progenitor-to-remnant mass-transfer function and the time-delay probability distribution between progenitor and remnant. We then cross-correlate these catalogues with galaxy samples modelled on the 2MASS Photometric Redshift catalogue (2MPZ) and the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalogue (Quaia). We find that the mass-transfer function has negligible effect on the cross-correlation signal, with differences remaining within redshift uncertainties. In contrast, the time-delay distribution dramatically affects the redshift distribution of the GW events and, with it, the cross-correlation signal, particularly for shallow galaxy catalogues. In particular, current-generation facilities can achieve significant detections only for the longest time delays when cross-correlated with 2MPZ, whilst all cross-correlations with the deeper Quaia catalogue are marginally detectable or consistent with zero. Our exploratory results thus demonstrate that forecasts on cosmological or astrophysical parameters derived from GW-galaxy cross-correlations are, as expected, strongly sensitive to the assumed binary formation history.",

        "abstract": "Astrochemical observations have revealed a surprisingly high level of chemical complexity, including long carbon chains, in the earliest stages of Sun-like star formation. The origin of these species and whether they undergo further growth, possibly contributing to the molecular complexity of planetary systems, remain open questions. We present recent observations performed using the 100-m Green Bank Telescope of the prestellar core L1544 and the protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422. In L1544, we detected several complex carbon-bearing species, including $\\mathrm{C_2S}$, $\\mathrm{C_3S}$, $\\mathrm{C_3N}$, $\\mathrm{c\\text{-}C_3H}$, $\\mathrm{C_4H}$, and $\\mathrm{C_6H}$, complementing previously reported emission of cyanopolyynes. In IRAS 16293-2422, we detected $\\mathrm{c\\text{-}C_3H}$ and, for the first time, $\\mathrm{HC_7N}$. Thanks to the high spectral resolution, we refine the rest frequencies of several $\\mathrm{c\\text{-}C_3H}$ and $\\mathrm{C_6H}$ transitions. We perform radiative transfer analysis, highlighting a chemical difference between the two sources: IRAS 16293-2422 shows column densities 10-100 times lower than L1544. We perform astrochemical modeling, employing an up-to-date chemical network with revised reaction rates. The models reproduce the general trends, with cyanopolyyne and polyynyl radical abundances decreasing as molecular size increases, but they underestimate the abundances of cyanopolyynes longer than $\\mathrm{HC_5N}$ by up to two orders of magnitude. Current models, which include the dominant neutral-neutral formation routes, cannot account for this discrepancy, suggesting that the chemical network is incomplete. We propose that additional ion-molecule reactions are crucial for the formation of these species. Developing a more comprehensive chemical network for long carbon chains is essential for accurately interpreting present and future observations.",

        "abstract": "Following the detections of the first extragalactic ``Luminous Red Nova'' (LRN) M31 RV in 1989, and its first Galactic counterpart V4332~Sgr in 1994, there have been many discoveries of similar, or closely related, objects. They are important because they bridge the luminosity gap between the brightest novae and supernovae, a largely unexplored parameter space. The cause of eruptions in LRNe is still unclear, a stellar merger being the most favored mechanism. However, barring V1309~Sco, there has been no direct evidence for a merger in the other objects. Here we present strong evidence that V4332~Sgr was a merger event. High resolution infrared observations of the CO fundamental band show an unusually small $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $3.5\\pm1$. This indicates that a violent event had occurred, whose effects penetrated deep enough to allow CNO cycle processed $^{13}$C in the inner H burning shell to be brought to the surface. We rule out planetary ingestion, and propose that the eruption was due to a merger between V4332~Sgr and a companion star. It is shown that V4332~Sgr was likely surrounded by an edge-on disk before its eruption. If this disk was a flattened common envelope containing V4332~Sgr and a companion star, then a merger scenario would not be inconsistent. Furthermore, V4332~Sgr had multiple outbursts, previously unreported but an important piece of information, since multiple outbursts are a trait shared by many LRNe.",

        "abstract": "Miras and other long-period variable (LPV) stars on the AGB follow period-luminosity (PL) relations. These relations have been difficult to study for Galactic LPVs because their distances were poorly known in the past. We aim to establish the PL relations of solar-neighbourhood Miras for several near-IR photometric bands. To this end, we used multi-epoch photometry from the DIRBE and unTimely/WISE catalogues, Gaia parallax distances, and contemporary pulsation periods obtained from optical observations of a well-selected sample of solar-neighbourhood Miras. We show that clearly defined PL relations in the nine investigated near-IR bands emerge from our data, and we report the slopes and zero-point magnitudes. We find that Galactic Miras are fainter in the near-IR than their Large Magellanic Cloud siblings. We derive average period-temperature, period-bolometric-luminosity, and period-radius relations from fits to synthetic SEDs constructed from the PL relations. By applying AGB evolutionary models, the scatter of stars around the PL sequences can also be used to test whether the parallax uncertainties quoted in the Gaia catalogue are realistic. Furthermore, we performed such tests based on a comparison with parallaxes obtained with the VLBI and with a sample of LPVs in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We conclude that, for Galactic Miras with a fractional parallax uncertainty of <0.1 in the Gaia catalogue, the parallax uncertainty is underestimated by factors between 1.0 and 1.7, and most likely by $\\sim1.3$. For more uncertain parallaxes, we find evidence that the distances (parallaxes) are generally overestimated (underestimated). Nevertheless, we find strong evidence that the large error-inflation factors reported for AGB stars in the literature are unrealistic. Our results lend confidence to the parallax measurements of these highly extended, variable stars.",

        "abstract": "Sensitivity of searches for extended emission around gamma-ray sources is naturally limited by the precision of the knowledge of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of gamma-ray telescopes. Inaccuracies in the PSF models of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) can potentially lead to false positive detections of source extension. We explore uncertainties in the Fermi/LAT PSF by comparing the PSF models provided by the Fermi/LAT Instrument Response Functions (IRFs) with signals of bright pulsars. We compare the analytical PSF models of Fermi/LAT IRFs with pulsar data and fit the pulsar data with the same analytical model as in the Fermi/LAT IRFs to derive an improved set of PSF parameters. We then apply this revised PSF parameterisation to the search of extended emission around a blazar, Mrk 501. We find that the parameters of the analytical PSF models of Fermi/LAT IRFs are inconsistent with the pulsar data. We obtain an improved set of PSF parameters from the fits to pulsar data that is consistent with observations. We find no evidence of the previously reported extended signal around Mrk 501 if the revised PSF consistent with pulsar data is used in data analysis.",

        "abstract": "We investigate whether a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can influence the internal dynamics of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Within this framework, the gravitational potential is modified by an additional term that captures the interaction between spacetime curvature and the dark matter with a coupling constant determined by a length scale $L$. Using spherical Jeans modeling, we analyze the kinematic data of three ultra-diffuse galaxies namely: NGC\\;1052-DF2, NGC\\;1052-DF4, and Dragonfly\\;44, which span the observational extremes from dark matter deficient to dark matter dominated systems. For each galaxy we explore several dark matter halo profiles, two orbital anisotropy models, and both with and without Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation scenarios, and we perform a Bayesian parameter inference. Our results show that across all the considered configurations, the constrained astrophysical parameters are consistent with standard ones from General Relativity. The posterior distributions of $L$ show no preference for non-zero values and result only in upper limits, suggesting that any non-minimal coupling contribution must be small and perturbative on this scales. Future high precision velocity measurements will be essential to determine whether non-minimal coupling effects can become observationally distinguishable in low-acceleration systems.",

Although the scales at which interactions occur in extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere are many orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, these violations might still be observable. In this work, the fluctuations in the number of muons in the extensive air showers measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory are exploited, for the first time, to constrain Lorentz invariance violations. The bounds derived in the hadronic sector are the strongest ever obtained, and do not rely on assumptions about the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The fluctuations in the number of muons constitute a new and powerful observable to further explore Lorentz invariance in a region of the parameter space not accessible to other observables.",

        "abstract": "4U 1556-60 is a low-mass X-ray binary that was discovered more than 50 years ago as a persistent X-ray source; however, very little was known about it. Recently, Gaia obtained a parallax for the optical counterpart that places 4U 1556-60 at a distance of only about 700 pc, making it one of the closest X-ray binaries known to date. This close distance drastically alters what was previously assumed about the source. We revisit 4U 1556-60 in light of the newly determined distance of 700 pc, reinterpreting its literature and presenting new X-ray and radio observations to better understand various characteristics of the system. We conclude that a scenario in which 4U 1556-60 is a candidate ultracompact neutron star X-ray binary at a distance of ~700 pc is able to explain the observed properties of the source. It resides at a persistent X-ray luminosity of ~2x10^34 erg/s, an unusual value for a typical X-ray binary, but similar to several ultracompact systems. The ratio of the X-ray to optical luminosity is very high, also suggesting a physically small accretion disk. The radio jet is undetected with a very deep upper limit of 3x10^25 erg/s, which is about 10^3 times fainter than the expected black hole jet correlation, strongly indicating a neutron star accretor. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by a power law, and the X-ray timing properties are also consistent with observations of other very low accretion rate X-ray binaries. No spin or orbital periodicity are found in the X-ray data. Future observations, especially to determine its orbital period, will further aid in understanding 4U 1556-60.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star systems can shed light on the currently unknown dense matter equation of state. The equation of state determines a large number of neutron star properties, such as tidal deformability, radius, and quadrupole moment, several of which directly affect the emitted gravitational-wave signals. To reduce the dimensionality when computing gravitational-waves and when interpreting observational data, quasi-universal relations are commonly employed to connect different neutron star properties. However, quasi-universal relations are not exact and their use may introduce uncertainty and bias. We explore the potential biases arising from different quasi-universal relations in the third generation era: (i) the Love-Q relation connecting the spin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability, (ii) the relation between the fundamental mode frequency and the tidal deformability, and (iii) the binary Love relation. We find that for the quadrupole relation biases are only present for rapidly rotating systems, for the binary-Love relation induces moderate biases only in the next-to-leading-order tidal parameters, which can however propagate into the inferred equation of state at low masses. Regarding fundamental mode frequencies, we find that the employed relation introduces only negligible biases, while waveform systematic effects can become comparatively large. Our results highlight that while quasi-universal relations remain a useful tool within gravitational-wave analyses, careful treatment is needed to avoid biases in equation of state measurements with next-generation detectors.",

        "abstract": "HESS J0852-463 is a TeV γ-ray source located in the Galactic plane. The region consists of a supernova remnant (SNR, RX J0852.0-4622) with a shell-like morphology, commonly referred to as Vela Junior, and a pulsar denoted PSR J0855-4644. Pulsars are among the most efficient leptonic accelerators in our Galaxy, making this region particularly interesting to study. We utilise the most recent data taken by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), to investigate any γ-ray emission associated with the pulsar in this region, PSR J0855-4644. We applied a full forward folding method on the H.E.S.S. data. Utilising 3D modelling techniques, we evaluated the TeV γ-ray emission towards the various components of this complex system. The distinct energy-dependent morphology observed in our data motivates further investigation of this source. We resolved the emission in the Vela Junior region into various components, several of which correspond to the SNR itself. In particular, we find a new extended component which is coincident with the position of PSR J0855-4644. The spectrum follows a power-law distribution with a best-fit index of ΓE = 1.81 \\pm 0.07stat which differs from the properties of the surrounding γ-ray emission of the Vela Junior SNR. A one-zone leptonic joint fit between the X-rays (from XMM-Newton) and γ-rays (from H.E.S.S.) leads to a lower limit on the magnetic field of 1.6μG and a spectral index of α = 1.88 \\pm 0.01, in line with expectations of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). In this paper, we report the first detection of the PWN of PSR J0855-4644 at TeV energies with the H.E.S.S. experiment at a significance of 12.2σ. This is attributed to the advanced techniques of the 3D analysis. Based on the pulsar's characteristics, its PWN is consistent with the known TeV PWNe population in the Galaxy.",

        "abstract": "Cosmic voids contain higher-order cosmological information and are of interest for astroparticle physics. Finding genuine matter underdensities in sparse galaxy surveys is, however, an underconstrained problem. Traditional void finding algorithms produce deterministic void catalogs, neglecting the probabilistic nature of the problem. We present a method to sample from the stochastic mapping from galaxy catalogs to arbitrary void definitions. Our algorithm uses a deep graph neural network to evolve \"test particles\" according to a flow-matching objective. We demonstrate the method in a simplified example setting but outline steps to generalize it towards practically usable void finders. Trained on a deterministic teacher, the model performs well but has considerable stochasticity which we interpret as regularization. Cosmological information in the predicted void catalogs outperforms the teacher. On the one hand, our method can cheaply emulate existing void finders with apparently useful regularization. More importantly, it also allows us to find the Bayes-optimal mapping between observed galaxies and any void definition. This includes definitions operating at the level of simulated matter density and velocity fields.",

        "abstract": "To explore the environmental mechanisms causing quenching in nearby star-forming galaxies, we study the variation with local and large-scale environments of a star formation concentration index, C-index $\\equiv\\log{(r_{50,{\\rm H}α}/r_{50,\\rm cont}})$, that traces the spatially-resolved distribution of H$α$ emission. Our analysis combines (i) GAMA spectroscopic redshift survey data to optically select galaxy groups and reconstruct the cosmic web, (ii) eROSITA data to identify X-ray-emitting groups, and (iii) SAMI Galaxy Survey data to characterise spatially-resolved star formation. We find that galaxies in X-ray+optical groups exhibit the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to optical groups and the field (independently of group or stellar mass). Star-forming galaxies in more X-ray luminous groups at fixed dynamical mass show more concentrated star formation. At large scales, nodes show the lowest median C-index and the highest fraction of centrally-concentrated star-forming galaxies relative to filaments and voids, which have similar C-index distributions. C-index correlates most strongly with the distance to the closest node, leaving no significant role for other local or large-scale environment metrics. Finally, regular star-forming galaxies tend to have spins aligned parallel to filaments, consistent with smooth gas accretion, while centrally-concentrated galaxies tend have spins aligned perpendicular to filaments, likely driven by mergers and associated with bulge growth. These results suggest that multi-scale environmental processes, i.e. locally and at large-scale, act to concentrate star formation toward galaxy centres, via gas-related mechanisms in nodes and ram-pressure stripping in X-ray+optical groups.",

        "abstract": "Context. Solid methane (CH$_4$) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds and a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on low-temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited. Aims. We aim to obtain spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compare it to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars at early stages. We also aim to test the obtained data applicability to JWST data interpretation. Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained on the ISEAge setup via FTIR spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted $χ^2$ minimization is used for the fitting. Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH$_4$:H$_2$O,CH$_4$:CO$_2$, CH$_4$:CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$:NH$_3$ at 6.7 K and 10 K showing a 20\\% increase in mixtures compared to commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also test the usability of the spectra on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II. Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H$_2$O environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of JWST observations. The dataset of spectra, publicly available on Zenodo, can be used for fitting JWST data.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic fields are known to efficiently redistribute angular momentum in stars. They have been recently measured in the cores of red giant stars using asteroseismology. It was shown that core magnetic fields, if unaccounted for, can bias the measurements of the gravity offset $ε_g$, which is otherwise well characterised for red giants. Exploiting this bias as a way to detect magnetic fields in the cores of red giants, we wish to increase the number of magnetic field detections in red giants, but also to establish a method that could be widely applicable to all red giants. We selected 218 Kepler red giants showing abnormal measured values of $ε_g$. We used robust statistical criteria based on the expected lifetime of mixed modes to identify significant modes. We then adjusted an asymptotic expression for mixed modes to the observed frequencies, taking magnetic field and rotation into account, using Bayesian inference. We then assessed the probability of magnetic field detection and measured the magnetic field intensity using stellar models for the favourable cases. We found new magnetic red giant stars with fields ranging from 34 to 260 kG. For these stars, we measured values for $ε_g$ now in agreement with the expected value. Adding these new detections to those of previous studies, we showed that the mass distribution of magnetic giants is similar to that of the complete catalogue of red giants, but different from the mass distribution of red giants with suppressed dipole modes. We also found that the core rotation of magnetic red giants follows a similar distribution as red giants in general. This could either mean that the detected fields do not have a predominant impact on the redistribution of angular momentum, or that other red giants also harbour an internal field that is currently non-detectable or has not yet been detected.",

        "abstract": "Foreground masking and incomplete sky coverage complicate CMB polarization analyses by inducing mode coupling and imperfect E/B separation, with particularly strong impact on searches for primordial $B$-modes. We present SkyReconNet-P, a convolutional neural network for inpainting CMB polarization maps that extends the SkyReconNet framework to jointly reconstruct the polarization $(Q,U)$ maps from partial-sky observations. The method combines regional processing with a hybrid design, utilizing standard convolution and dilated convolution to do a multiscale feature integration. We evaluate performance at both the map and power spectrum level using two masking scenarios: a generated random mask and the Planck 2018 common polarization inpainting mask. For both masking scenarios, SkyReconNet-P reproduces the large-scale morphology of the target maps. In power-spectrum space, we find that the reconstructed $E$-mode spectrum closely tracks the target at low multipoles, while small biases emerge at higher $\\ell$. For $B$-mode, the raw reconstructed spectra exhibit a larger multipole-dependent bias, which we mitigate using a simulation-based linear calibration. We show that the calibrated $B$-mode spectrum preserve more information by comparing it with spectrum estimation using pseudo-$C_\\ell$. Finally, we demonstrate cosmological parameter inference from calibrated reconstructed spectra by fitting $(r, A_{\\rm lens})$ with a Gaussian bandpower likelihood, recovering posteriors consistent with injected parameters across three test ensembles down to $r \\sim 10^{-3}$. These results support inpainting as a complementary route to cut-sky approaches when downstream pipelines can greatly benefit from statistically well-characterized, gap-filled polarization maps.",

Physically, one must describe the impact of cosmological bulk flows which progressively and anisotropically smear out the feature over time. One must also model the effects of the scale dependence of tracer bias and the mode coupling between short and long scales. All of these can be incorporated using the Zel'dovich approximation alone, without reference to any particular cosmological model. On the technical front, one needs a robust, complete and cosmology-independent basis to describe the shape of the real space BAO feature in linear theory, which can then be propagated to the nonlinearly evolved, measured feature in redshift space. In this work, we describe how these ingredients -- which we have systematically constructed in recent work -- come together in an accurate framework capable of describing the BAO-scale pairwise measurements of state-of-the-art galaxy surveys. Using mock observations and $N$-body simulations, we show that our template-free framework can produce unbiased and precise cosmological constraints for samples with realistic levels of nonlinearity. This work represents one of the final steps in constructing a data-ready analysis framework for model-agnostic cosmological inference from the BAO feature.",

We introduce a framework that accelerates posterior inference while maintaining accuracy by combining learned latent representations with local simulator-guided optimization. A masked U-Net is first pretrained to reconstruct complete light curves from partial observations and to produce informative latent embeddings. Given a query light curve, we identify similar simulated light curves from the simulation bank by measuring similarity in the learned embedding space produced by pretrained U-Net encoder, yielding an initial empirical approximation to the posterior over parameters. This initialization is then refined using a local optimization procedure using hill-climbing updates, guided by a forward simulator, progressively shifting the empirical posterior toward higher-likelihood parameter regions. Experiments on the observed light curve of PSR J0030+0451, captured by NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), show that our method closely matches posterior estimates obtained using traditional MCMC methods while achieving 120 times reduction in inference time (from 24 hours to 12 minutes), demonstrating the effectiveness of learned representations and simulator-guided optimization for accelerated posterior inference.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel quantum effect wherein particle spectra show extra broadening due to local short-time acceleration (as well as in a deSitter spacetime background). This effect provides a simple interpretation for the acceleration interpolation relation required to modify the kinematics of a test particle in the Modified Inertial interpretation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). This effect can be regarded as a generalization of the thermal blackbody spectrum generated by the Unruh effect (which arises from long-time uniform acceleration in a flat background) to the scenario of local short-time non-uniform acceleration. This effect offers a unified framework for understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the anomalies in galactic rotation curves or radial acceleration. It is worth emphasizing that this modified kinematic interpretation of MOND necessitates a quantum equivalence principle as its physical foundation, that is, extending the equivalence at the level of expectation values (first-order moments) in the classical equivalence principle to the equivalence at the level of second-order moment quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the role of this effect within the frameworks of quantum reference frames and quantum gravity is also discussed to some extent.",

        "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the discovery of hundreds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $z\\gtrsim 4-7$. A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these ``overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered ``overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star \\sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim 10^8~M_\\odot$ with $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star \\sim 0.01$. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations. This suggests that the global feedback mechanisms regulating the coevolution of $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$ ratios are implicitly encoded in local relations in terms of star-formation rate distribution, black hole accretion rate distribution and their active (quiescent) fractions.",

The results show that although the kinetic quantities and the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) depend on the regularization parameter $g$, the radiative efficiency of the rotating SV black hole is the same as its Kerr counterpart. Within the Novikov-Thorne thin-disk model, the radiative flux, effective temperature, and spectral luminosity are studied, and by adopting observational parameters relevant to SgrA* and M87*, concrete examples of the rotating SV black holes are calculated and compared with that of the Kerr black holes. The results show that the parameter $g$ suppresses the maximum values of these quantities. In addition, using a backward ray-tracing technique, we numerically simulate the optical appearance of rotating SV black holes and analyze the corresponding intensity images, redshift and observed flux distributions. Our results show that these quantities are affected by $g$. In particular, as $g$ increases, the observed intensity is significantly suppressed and the photon ring region has remarkable increase in its width. Our findings suggest that accretion-disk-related observables may provide important avenues to distinguish rotating SV black holes and Kerr black holes, and offer theoretical guidance for future high-resolution observations.",

        "abstract": "PS1-12sk is a type Ibn supernova (SN) found at the host environment showing no obvious ongoing star formation, which challenges the massive star explosion scenario. We use the ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction (CSI) and the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni models in the context of double white dwarf (WD) merger to fit the bolometric light curve (LC) of PS1-12sk, since the He emission lines at the photospheric phases indicated the interaction between the SN ejecta and He-rich CSM. We find that the CSI model failed to explain the LC, but the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni model can account for the bolometric LC. The derived masses of the two WDs and $^{56}$Ni are $\\sim 0.70 M_\\odot$, $\\sim 0.40 M_\\odot$, and $\\sim 0.09\\,M_\\odot$, respectively. The facts that the ejecta mass ($\\sim 0.984 M_\\odot$) is well below the Chandrasekhar limit ($\\sim 1.4 M_\\odot$) and that the $^{56}$Ni mass is comparable to the $^{56}$Ni yields of the explosions of some sub-Chandrasekhar explosion models support the scenario that PS1-12sk might be from a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion induced by the merger of two low-mass WDs. The derived innermost radius ($\\sim 13.81 \\times 10^{12}$ cm) and the mass of the CSM ($\\sim 0.116 M_\\odot$) disfavor the possibility that the CSM was formed in the merger phase. We suggest that the flybys before the merger can account for the position and mass of the CSM.",

While the data suggest the possibility of the phantom crossing, it is worth thoroughly exploring quintessence models. Given that phenomenological parametrisations of the equation-of-state parameter $w(a)$ with a sharp transitional feature fit the data well, we study the realisation of such models in quintessence. In the late Universe, the quintessence field begins to oscillate abruptly, changing the behaviour of $w$. Naturally, such a model entails tachyonic instability, and particle production modifies $w$. We perform numerical lattice simulations to study the time dependence of $w$. In addition, the violent particle production produces significant density perturbations and the stochastic gravitational-wave background, whose characteristic scale depends on the mass scale of the quintessence around the minimum of the potential. We discuss the observability of these late-time cosmological signals through cosmic microwave background, quasar astrometry, pulsar timing arrays, and other observational probes.",

Identifying the low-order QPO frequencies as fundamental oscillations, and frequencies of $567.7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ or $655.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ (rest frame) as first overtone candidates, implies neutron star mass ranges of $1.00$--$1.55\\,M_\\odot$ or $1.17$--$1.76\\,M_\\odot$, respectively. The radius is also constrained, with a self-consistent value around $13$~km, further supported by the calculation of the NS structure within the low-mass/low-central density regime. Simultaneously, we also constrain another nuclear saturation parameter, namely the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density (i.e., the slope parameter), $L$, and determine it to be $L=59.5-96.8$ MeV with $\\sim 10\\%$ systematic uncertainty, which is broadly consistent with previous constraints on $L$ obtained from experiments and astronomical observations. Thus, a mapping of FRB QPOs to crustal torsional modes seems reasonable. This can be confirmed with upcoming FRB surveys over a broad range of redshifts and more elaborate data analyses.",

        "abstract": "Fuzzy sphere models conjecturally realize 3d CFTs in small systems of spinful fermions, but why they work so well is still not fully understood. Their Hamiltonians are built from electron density operators projected to the lowest Landau Level. We analyze the algebra of the density modes and verify that it satisfies the Jacobi identity. The fuzzy sphere geometry admits two thermodynamic limits: a local planar limit yielding the fuzzy plane, and a commutative limit yielding an ordinary sphere. In the planar limit, high-angular-momentum modes recover the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, whereas in the commutative limit the low-angular-momentum modes become semiclassical. We further find an explicit representation of the conformal algebra so(3,2) in the minimal two-electron system and extend it to larger systems via an so(3) equivariant coproduct. Because the coproduct splits one so(3) representation into a tensor product, it is structurally mismatched with the thermodynamic limit of critical fuzzy sphere Hamiltonians.",

In this geometry, the inelastic tunneling conductance can be expressed directly in terms of real-space spin correlations, establishing a link between measurable spectra and the underlying fractionalized excitations. We show that spin vacancies host localized Majorana states that generate sharp near-zero-bias features, well separated from the continuum of bulk spin excitations. Compared to local STM measurements, the planar configuration naturally enhances the signal by coherently summing over multiple vacancies, reducing spatial resolution requirements. Our results demonstrate a realistic and scalable route to detect Majorana excitations in Kitaev materials.",

We present a controlled theory of skyrmion Chern bands generated by such textures. An exact local $SU(2)$ transformation reveals an emergent non-Abelian gauge field; for large branch splitting we perform an operator-level Schrieffer-Wolff expansion, yielding a single-branch Hamiltonian together with systematically dressed physical operators that define the projected interacting theory beyond strict adiabaticity. The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor. In a Landau-level representation built from the averaged emergent field, moiré-periodic modulations induce Umklapp-resolved deformations of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman kinematics and microscopic sources of excess optical quantum weight above the topological lower bound. Assuming a gapped Hall phase, we further derive a skyrmion-crystal effective field theory with a universal Berry-phase term and a noncommutative magnetophonon. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and rhombohedral graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride.",

For disordered superconductors, the optical conductivity often can be described within Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, while in corresponding tunneling experiments, deviations in the observed DOS typically require modelling by the phenomenological Dynes formula. The implications of such Dynes DOS for optics were rarely discussed so far. Here we probe the terahertz conductivity of superconducting NbN thin films with thicknesses ranging from 4.5 to 20nm, which were grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Our frequency range from 0.3 to 2.1 THz covers energies below and above the spectral gap. For 20nm thick NbN, we find in the optical conductivity distinct deviations from the BCS model, including a step-like characteristic in the absorption at half the zero-temperature spectral gap. These observations can be fully captured by Dynes electrodynamics with a small and temperature-independent pair-breaking rate. For the other films, we also observe signs of Dynes electrodynamics, and we discuss the evolution of the energy gap, the superfluid density, and the pair-breaking rate as function of film thickness.",

We demonstrate that stacking order is an effective control knob for cross-plane phonon transport in multilayer Rhenium Disulfide (ReS2). Thickness-dependent thermal conductivity measurements reveal remarkably long cross-plane phonon mean free paths (MFPs) (>= 200-300 nm) and provide a direct experimental observation of the transition from quasi-ballistic transport to a thickness-independent ballistic limit. AA stacking exhibits nearly double the cross-plane thermal conductivity of AB stacking, driven by longer acoustic phonon lifetimes from a more \"coherent\" interlayer registry. Integrated deep neural-network molecular dynamics reveals that phonon filtering in ReS2 is fundamentally frequency-selective: weak vdW coupling acts as a low-pass filter, whereas stronger coupling broadens the transmission passband. These results establish ReS2 as a model system where stacking order and interlayer coupling can be engineered to tune heat conduction across diffusive, quasi-ballistic, and ballistic regimes, offering a new framework for thermal management in 2D electronics.",

Using Nematic Bond Theory, a diagrammatic self-consistent method, we study the nematostriction that happens when the onset of nematic order in the spin-system drives a concomitant structural phase transition. We analyze the mechanisms by which the magnetoelastic couplings renormalize the critical temperature and modify the phonon spectrum. The magnetoelastic feeback can also alter fundamentally the nature of the phase transition. Specifically, on the square lattice, the transition shifts from continuous to weakly first-order (discontinuous) beyond a critical magnetoelastic coupling threshold. Conversely, on the triangular lattice, the transition remains discontinuous regardless of coupling strength.",

We show that spatial variations of the Néel order act on the low-energy electrons as effective gauge fields, leading to strong anisotropies in both dc transport and optical absorption, even without intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. As a concrete example, we analyze a coplanar spin helix and predict that the principal axes of the conductivity and linear dichroism are set by the helix wave vector and can be tuned by the texture geometry. Our results point to polarization-resolved optics and anisotropic transport as direct probes of textured altermagnetic states, and suggest a simple route to direction-selectivity.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how stick-slip dynamics manifests in diverse physical conditions is a crucial topic in tribology. Although it has been extensively studied in simple frictional configurations, the characterization of stick-slip behavior in complex assemblies is challenging. This work presents the first systematic investigation of stick-slip dynamics in a system with multiple contact surfaces undergoing friction amplification through conversion of traction forces into normal compression. Using interleaved paper blocks as a model system, we combine force measurements and image processing to characterize stick-slip events occurring when the two blocks are pulled apart at different detachment velocities. We find that both the peak force and the amplitude of the stick-slip events decrease along with the system's detachment. By combining a previously designed model for friction amplification and the stick-slip dynamics predicted by a simple frictional spring-block system, we link the observed behavior to the evolving normal compression within the assembly. Through force measurements and imaging, we extract the effective stiffness of the system from stick-slip events at low velocities and relate it to the system's normal compression. We then predict the observed decrease of the global stiffness as function of the detachment by considering the spatial distribution of normal forces within the assembly, which determines an effective number of sheets contributing to the system's mechanical response. Our findings reveal a non-trivial interplay between internal stress distribution and mechanical response mediated by frictional forces, with implications for granular materials, textiles, fibrous systems, and mechanical metamaterials.",

        "abstract": "While stoichiometric SrRuO$_3$ (SRO) is a metallic itinerant ferromagnet with relatively homogeneous magnetization, Ru deficiency provides a powerful route to alter its electronic transport and depth-dependent magnetic properties. Ru-deficient SRO thin films grown by radio-frequency high oxygen pressure sputtering were investigated using a combination of X-ray reflectivity, polarized neutron reflectometry, off-specular neutron scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrical transport, and magnetometry. Structural and compositional analyses reveal that Ru deficiency is intrinsic to the films, with an enhanced deficiency at the interfaces. As a result, coherent electronic transport is suppressed and the saturation magnetization is reduced, while the Curie temperature remains largely unaffected, placing Ru-deficient SRO in a regime consistent with ferromagnetic insulator-like behavior. Depth- and lateral-resolved magnetic measurements further show that the interfacial regions remain ferromagnetic but exhibit enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which constrains the local magnetization to remain predominantly out-of-plane and strongly reduces its in-plane projection. Our results establish Ru deficiency as a key control parameter governing transport, magnetization, and anisotropy in SRO thin films and highlight defect and interface engineering as powerful routes to tailor interfacial magnetism in correlated oxide heterostructures.",

In contrast, lower sputtering pressure promotes void filling in deposited films, favouring the growth of dense, low roughness columnar films. Modification of native SiOx on Si surfaces via substrate preheating prior to deposition, alters the initial nucleation stage, thereby determining dominant polarity and morphology of ZnO nanostructures. O polar columnar films and nanocolumns exhibit higher effective piezoelectric coefficient, corresponding to their higher differential resistance and reduced dielectric loss, suggesting suppressed carrier induced screening of piezoelectric charges. This low thermal budget, scalable sputtering approach provides an alternative route for integrating ZnO nanostructures onto thermal constrained substrates, including those used in flexible and wearable electronics.",

Using an improved dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method, we investigate the relevant intermediate $J_2$ regime for cylinders with circumferences from 6 to 9. Depending on the initial state and boundary conditions, we find two {\\it distinct} variational states. The higher energy state is consistent with a Dirac QSL. In the lower-energy state, both the static and dynamical properties are qualitatively similar to the magnetically ordered state at $J_2=0$, suggestive of either a weakly magnetically ordered non-QSL or a gapped QSL proximate to a continuous transition to such an ordered state.",

So far, studies on the electronic structure of transition metal dipnictides have focused on their overall electronic structure and the bulk open-orbit Fermi surfaces. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and transport measurements, we distinguish the intertwined bulk and surface states on the weakly topological $(20\\bar{1})$ plane of TaSb$_2$. We identify multiple electron- and hole-like bulk bands, yielding a near-perfect carrier compensation. Crucially, we observe open-orbit FSs parallel to $\\bar{L}$-$\\bar{Y}$ direction that are entirely of surface origin. Circular-dichroism ARPES reveals $k \\rightarrow -k$ spectral reversal, indicating spin-momentum locking and the topological nature of these surface states. Consistent with this, magnetotransport measurements display weak antilocalization, establishing TaSb$_2$ as a platform for spin-polarized topological transport on a weakly topological surface.",

We present the results of IXS under high hydrostatic pressure induced by diaond anvils and show how the EPC in EuAl4 is renormalized and suppressed in the material's temperature-pressure phase diagram. Our findings highlight the crucial role of momentum-dependent EPC in the formation of the CDW in EuAl4 and provide further insights into how external pressure can be used to tune charge ordering in quantum materials.",

Established experimental probes of light-induced topological states include ultrafast transport and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, each with important strengths but also well-known limitations. Here we propose ultrafast terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) as a real space energy-resolved probe of Floquet physics. We show that THz-STM enables direct local detection of bulk Floquet gaps and distinct Floquet edge state signatures. We derive a nonequilibrium Green's-function formalism for time-dependent tunneling that directly extends standard STM theory and provides an intuitive interpretation of rectified ultrafast tunneling currents. We apply the approach to bulk graphene and graphene nanoribbons of variable width. For the bulk, we show that THz-STM provides direct spectroscopic access to Floquet-induced gap openings, and we contrast pulsed pump-probe protocols with the continuous-wave Floquet steady-state limit. For finite ribbons, we demonstrate time- and space-resolved imaging of Floquet-induced topological edge states and identify the ribbon-width scale below which edge state protection breaks down. We further show how band structures of graphene nanoribbons and Floquet chiral edge modes can be reconstructed via Floquet quasiparticle interference. Finally we demonstrate that chiral impurities that break time-reversal symmetry induce characteristic spatial THz-STM signatures that can be used as a direct probe of Floquet edge state chirality.",

        "abstract": "Point defects in silicon carbide (SiC), particularly the negatively-charged silicon vacancy ($\\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$) in 4H-SiC, are leading candidates for scalable quantum technologies due to their favorable spin-optical properties and compatibility with industrial semiconductor fabrication processes. Comprehensive knowledge of a defect's electronic structure is essential for interpreting spin-optical dynamics and for the reliable design and optimization of defect-based quantum devices. Despite extensive study, our knowledge of the electronic structure of $\\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\\ is limited since key excited-state manifolds have remained inaccessible to conventional steady-state spectroscopy. In this study, transient absorption spectroscopy is utilized to probe non-equilibrium electronic transitions of $\\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\\ and to uncover previously unobserved excited states. The first direct observation of the elusive V2' quartet transition is presented, with its broad spectral signature attributed to nonadiabatic vibronic coupling. Within the spin-doublet manifold, which is central to optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) but has remained unresolved spectroscopically, multiple optical transitions are identified. The complete electronic level structure in the relevant energy range is elucidated by combining polarization-resolved spectroscopy, group-theoretical analysis, quantum embedding calculations and first-principles optical lineshape modeling. Collectively, these results provide a microscopic understanding of the $\\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\\ electronic structure. Our approach also establishes a general framework for resolving and understanding complex excited-state manifolds in wide-bandgap color centers.",

Conventional RF approaches, which fabricate the Lenz lens onto the diamond anvil itself, preclude the placement of electrical circuits. Our method overcomes this limitation by transferring the RF sensor to a composite Ta-based gasket. The sensor consists of single-turn microcoils that are formed by magnetron sputtering a gold film onto an insulating Ta$_2$O$_5$ layer. The Lenz lens topology is then patterned using focused ion beam etching. We validated this technique using polycrystalline Cu1234 and Bi2212 high-$\\textit{T$_c$}$ superconductors at ambient and high pressures. The measurements consistently identified the superconducting transition temperature across carrier frequencies from 111 kHz to 200 MHz. This new gasket technique establishes a reliable and sensitive tool for contactless studies of superconductivity under high pressure.",

        "abstract": "We study the proximity effect in the Hubbard model coupled to BCS superconductors describing a single-layer strongly correlated electron system in a phase-biased Josephson junction. We find two distinct gapped solutions, one Mott-like insulating (M-phase) and one proximitized superconducting phase (S-phase), separated by first-order transition with hysteresis. In the M-phase the large correlation charge gap strongly suppresses the critical current, while the S-phase behaves as a $0$-junction, with a proximitized gap that closes for $φ=π$ to yield a correlated metal. Phase bias and junction transparency can thus serve as tuning knobs to switch between conducting and insulating regimes. Working within the dynamical mean field theory using the numerical renormalization group as the impurity solver, we associate M- and S-phase solutions with the doublet and singlet fixed points of the underlying superconducting Anderson impurity problem. We obtain detailed insight into the spectral structure on all energy scales. In the M-phase, the self-energy has sub-gap resonances symmetrically located around the Fermi level resulting from the splitting of the ''mid-gap pole'' found in Mott insulators; this structure accounts for phase insensitivity.",

Hexagonal FeS (h-FeS) is a recently identified altermagnet candidate that shows a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) accompanied by a tiny net magnetization. Here, we show that both the spontaneous AHE and magnetization can be effectively suppressed by an in-plane compressive strain. Since neutron diffraction measurements show that the applied uniaxial strain only modifies the in-plane domain population but does not affect the in-plane magnetic structure, the major effect of the applied strain is to tune the small $c$-axis ferromagnetic moment. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between the tiny net magnetization and the spontaneous AHE in h-FeS, and show that uniaxial strain provides an effective knob to tune both properties in this altermagnet candidate for spintronic applications.",

The emergence of a spin deviation from the local quantization axis of one residing QD is the prerequisite to implement the qubit gates. In this work, we study the non-adiabatic dynamics of a spin qubit shuttling between coupled QDs with inhomogeneous Landé g-tensors and a small magnetic field. The spin dynamics is analyzed through solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the qubit under the effects of spin-orbit interaction and rapid ramping inter-dot detuning. The precondition, imposed on the ramping time and the tunnel-coupling strength, to ensure a high-fidelity inter-dot transfer is estimated. We then calculate the change in the spin orientation of a transferred qubit, and study the dependences of the spin deviation on the difference in the quantization axes of the two QDs, the tunnel-coupling strength, and the ramping time. We also demonstrate that the effect of multiple rounds of inter-dot bidirectional shuttling can be captured by an operator matrix, and evaluate the idling times required for realizing the single-qubit Pauli-X and Pauli-Y gates. Intriguingly, it is confirmed that a generalized Hadamard gate can be achieved through tuning the idling times.",

While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits. We show that, both topological ground state degeneracy and the chiral edge mode can be faithfully captured by this approach. We demonstrate our approach using the Kitaev honeycomb model, finding excellent agreement of low-energy excitation spectrum on quantum circuits with exact solution in all topological sectors. Further applying this approach to a non-exactly solvable chiral spin liquid model on square lattice, the results suggest this approach works well even when the topological sectors are not exactly known.",

        "abstract": "This study numerically investigates magnetisation reversal processes driven by an external magnetic field in three-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin models with weak random field disorder. Considering an extremely weak disorder and low temperature, we observe a step-wise hysteresis loop and the appearance of short magnetisation bursts of a characteristic triangular shape; the number of bursts increases with disorder, indicative of Barkhausen-type noise. These phenomena are attributed to the simultaneous reversal at a given external field of segments composed of spins with identical neighbourhoods. A local random field orients one or more spin neighbours, resulting in small, ferromagnetic-like clusters distributed throughout the system. As disorder increases, these clusters may merge to form a labyrinthine structure within the antiferromagnetic background, facilitating brief avalanche propagation. The results demonstrate that, compared with familiar random-field ferromagnets, the observed antiferromagnetic Barkhausen noise and the related avalanche sequence have a profoundly different structure, organised into peaks associated with the transition between magnetisation plateaus. They exhibit prominent cyclical trends and disorder-dependent multifractal fluctuations, with the singularity spectrum quantifying the degree of disorder. The activity avalanches exhibit scale invariance resembling that recently found in experiments with disordered ferr\\textit{i}magnets and martensites, as well as in quantum Barkhausen noise, which are associated with active geometric regions rather than individual-spin dynamics. The observed scaling behaviour is interpreted in terms of self-organised critical dynamics.",

Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ is an antiferromagnet with the distorted kagome lattice of Ce atoms, in which several fractional magnetization plateaus emerge with the increase of magnetic field. At the 1/2 magnetization plateau, obvious hysteresis has been observed in the magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity during the rise and fall of the magnetic field. However, hysteresis vanishes in the corresponding measurements of magnetization, indicating the existence of degenerate states with the same net magnetization but different electronic transport properties. The degenerate states can be connected by the time-reversal-like operation. In addition, by comparing with HoAgGe, it is suggested that the special crystal structure in Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ may have a shielding effect on the time-reversal-like operation, thereby affecting the distinction of degenerate states. Our work establishes Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ as an example of utilizing electronic transport properties to identify and distinguish hidden symmetries in frustrated magnetic systems.",

Here we report its experimental realization using two optically trapped microparticles subjected to a bang-bang effective temperature protocol. Despite their distinct relaxation times, both degrees of freedom are steered to their respective equilibrium states simultaneously in a finite minimal time. We provide a complete time-resolved characterization of the nonequilibrium dynamics through the evolution of the position variances and the entropy production within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, enabling a quantitative comparison with direct relaxation and a suboptimal protocol. In addition, we employ information-geometric tools -- recently referred to as thermal kinematics -- to track the system's path in state space with a single dynamical quantity. Our results show that faster equilibration requires a larger entropy production and an increased thermodynamic length, revealing a direct trade-off between temporal optimality and thermodynamic cost in multidimensional stochastic systems driven by a single intensive control parameter.",

Determining when the linear approximation can be trusted typically requires knowledge of second-order corrections, which are often difficult to compute explicitly. In this letter, I propose a self-consistent criterion for the validity of linear response, formulated in terms of a typical length scale that emerges from the fluctuation-response inequality within the theory itself. The result applies to classical open systems. I illustrate the criterion with explicit examples of Brownian particles in harmonic traps, and classical open systems presenting Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Finally, I discuss the physical meaning of this typical length, providing both thermodynamic and information-theoretic interpretations.",

        "abstract": "Non-Hermitian systems with globally reciprocal couplings -- such as the Hatano-Nelson model with stochastic imaginary gauge fields -- avoid the conventional non-Hermitian skin effect, displaying erratic bulk localization while retaining ballistic transport. An open question is whether similar behavior arises when non-reciprocity originates at the Liouvillian level rather than from an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian obtained via post-selection. Here we investigate this scenario in a lattice model with globally reciprocal Liouvillian dynamics and locally asymmetric incoherent hopping, a disordered setting in which Liouvillian-specific effects have remained largely unexplored. While the steady state again shows disorder-dependent, erratic localization without boundary accumulation, we find that global reciprocity in the Liouvillian does not protect transport. Instead, in the regime dominated by incoherent hopping, excitations spread via Sinai-type subdiffusion, dramatically slower than the ordinary diffusion found in symmetric stochastic lattices. Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between globally reciprocal Hamiltonian and Liouvillian dynamics: global reciprocity suppresses the skin effect in both cases, but only in Liouvillian dynamics can it coexist with ultra-slow, disorder-induced subdiffusive transport.",

Here, we present a theoretical study of decoherence arising from the electromagnetic interaction of free electrons with bulk materials and planar surfaces. We show that bulk plasmons dominate decoherence in Al and Au, while electronic excitations above the band gap, supplemented by weaker coupling to phononic and guided modes, are the primary channels in ionic insulators such as LiF. A thermal population of electromagnetic modes leads to a divergence in the energy-loss probability at low frequencies, which in turn produces a pronounced temperature dependence. We show that this effect can be exploited for nanoscale thermometry, predicting that optimized energy-filtered holography enables $\\sim0.1\\%$ changes in fringe visibility for physically viable temperature variations in metals. Through these results, we establish a unified theoretical framework to describe free-electron decoherence in the bulk and surfaces of arbitrary materials.",

We investigate a cryptographic scheme based on discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) on cyclic graphs that exploits Parrondo dynamics, wherein periodic evolution emerges from a deterministic sequence of individually chaotic coin operators. We construct an explicit quantum circuit realization tailored to NISQ architectures and analyze its performance through numerical simulations in Qiskit under both ideal and noisy conditions. Protocol performance is quantified using probability distributions, Hellinger fidelity, and total variation distance. To assess security at the circuit level, we model intercept-resend and man-in-the-middle attacks and evaluate the resulting quantum bit error rate. In the absence of adversarial intervention, the protocol enables reliable message recovery, whereas eavesdropping induces characteristic disturbances that disrupt the periodic reconstruction mechanism. We further examine hardware feasibility on contemporary NISQ processors, specifically $ibm\\_torino$, incorporating qubit connectivity and state-transfer constraints into the circuit design. Our analysis demonstrates that communication between spatially separated logical modules increases circuit depth via SWAP operations, leading to cumulative noise effects. By exploring hybrid state-transfer strategies, we show that qubit selection and connectivity play a decisive role in determining fidelity and overall protocol performance, highlighting hardware-dependent trade-offs in NISQ implementations.",

Aluminium and its oxide (AlOx) have dominated cryogenic tunnel junction technology for decades due to the high quality of AlOx barriers and Al superconducting properties below 1.2 K. However, many applications require non-superconducting junctions, either standalone or in combination with superconducting technology, motivating efforts to suppress Al superconductivity through magnetic fields, doping, or proximity effects -- approaches that so far suffered from integration compatibility and scalability issues. Here, we present a CMOS-compatible normal-metal tunnel junction technology based on TiW alloy and AlOx barriers. We demonstrate wafer-scale fabrication of TiW/Al-AlOx/TiW junctions and validate their performance in Coulomb blockade thermometers operating down to 20 mK, confirming robust normal-state behavior. This TiW-based architecture offers a scalable solution for non-superconducting tunnel junctions across a broad temperature range, enabling integration into advanced cryogenic, quantum and nanoelectronic chip-level systems.",

        "abstract": "The study of spin decoherence is often performed by assuming that spin-phonon interactions lead to relaxation at high temperatures, and spin-spin dipolar interactions instead contribute to pure dephasing at low temperatures. This has resulted in the neglect of spin relaxation due to spin-spin dipolar interactions and its influence on decoherence at low temperatures. For a complete understanding of low temperature spin dynamics, it is then imperative to focus also on the latter mechanism. One such method which has shown great promise in the efficient calculation of central spin dynamics due to spin-spin dipolar interactions with a surrounding spin bath is the Cluster-Correlation Expansion (CCE). An extension of this method through the explicit inclusion of the central spin degrees of freedom, known as the generalized Cluster-Correlation Expansion (gCCE) is capable of simulating the transfer of energy from the central spin into the bath, and thus could have the potential to investigate spin relaxation in this setting. In this work, we show that gCCE, in its standard form, is insufficient for providing even a qualitatively accurate description of spin-spin relaxation. A full mathematical deconstruction of the underlying theory of gCCE clearly points to the origin of such a breakdown and provides a starting point for its potential future resolution.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of nonrelativistic spin splitting in collinear compensated antiferromagnets, several candidate materials have also been proposed, among which the family of transition-metal difluorides stands out as a prominent example. Within this family, most members exhibit planar $d$-wave spin splitting, whereas CuF$_2$ shows bulk $d$-wave splitting with an explicit $k_z$ dependence. In this work, we show that this transition from planar to bulk $d$-wave splitting in CuF$_2$ is primarily driven by the antipolar displacements of the F ions, which are absent in the tetragonal rutile structure of the other family members. Our calculations reveal that these additional structural distortions introduce an extra plane of anisotropic magnetization density, giving rise to an additional totally symmetric component of the magnetic octupole tensor. The $k$-space representation of this octupole component, consequently, dictates an additional direction of spin splitting, thereby transforming the $d$-wave spin splitting pattern from planar to bulk-like. We further analyze the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic octupoles and the resulting spin splitting in the band structure. Our work highlights the possibility of controlling the pattern of nonrelativistic spin splitting through structural modifications, for example, via the application of external pressure.",

        "abstract": "Solute segregation to interfaces significantly impacts material behavior. A large majority of theoretical works focus on grain boundaries and coherent interfaces. Studies on semi-coherent interfaces are usually prohibited by the structural complexity, yielding models beyond the practical capability of density functional theory (DFT), or chemical complexity, restricted by the availability of (classical) interatomic potentials. This work investigates solute segregation to the coherent and semi-coherent $α$-Fe/Fe$_3$C interface in pearlite and its effect on mechanical properties using novel universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). DFT calculated solution enthalpies, segregation energetics, and changes in cohesion at the coherent interface are used to benchmark several state-of-the-art uMLIPs. We find that the GRACE-2L-OAM and GRACE-2L-OMAT models most accurately reproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions. While Cu has the strongest segregation energy of $\\approx$ -0.3 eV to the coherent interface among the investigated tramp and trace elements, all of them, As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Sb, and Sn, exhibit significantly more negative segregation values reaching below $\\approx$ -1.5 eV in the presence of the misfit dislocation at the semi-coherent interface. The deepest traps are identified in the vicinity of the dislocation core, although the spatial distribution of segregation energies differs markedly among the solute species. The cohesion of the coherent interface is strongly reduced by Sb, Sn, P, and As, and only mildly by Cu, whereas Ni shows a negligible effect, and Cr and Mo slightly enhance cohesion. In contrast, all investigated solutes (except for P) tend to embrittle the semi-coherent interface, with Sn and, especially, Sb having the strongest impact in tensile tests performed in the out-of-plane direction.

        "abstract": "Nonequilibrium many-body physics is one of the core problems in modern physics, while the dynamical scaling from a gapless phase to the critical point is a most important challenge with very few knowledge so far. In the driven dynamics with a tuning rate $R$ across the quantum critical point (QCP) of a system with size $L$, the finite-time scaling shows that the square of the order parameter $m^2$ obeys a simple scaling relation $m^2\\propto R^{2β/νr}$ in the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling limit with $RL^r\\gg1$. Here, by studying the driven critical dynamics from a gapless ordered phase in the bilayer Heisenberg model, we unveil that the approaches to the scaling region dominated by the KZ scaling limit with $RL^r\\gg1$ are {\\it non-commutative}: this scaling region is inaccessible for large $R$ and finite medium $L$, while merely accessible for large $L$ and moderately finite $R$. We attribute this to the memory effect induced by the finite-size correction in the gapless ordered phase. This non-commutative property makes $m^2$ still strongly depends on the system size and deviates from $m^2\\propto R^{2β/νr}$ even for large $R$. We further show that a similar correction applies to the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics. Our results establish an essential extension of nonequilibrium scaling theory with a gapless ordered initial state.",

The neutron experiments find no evidence for low-energy excitations with ferromagnetic character, which contrasts to the findings in $α$-RuCl$_{3}$. Our results are consistent with a recently proposed microscopic model that involves an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg nearest-neighbor exchange in Na$_2$IrO$_3$ in contrast to the ferromagnetic one considered for $α$-RuCl$_{3}$. Although the magnetic response shows the signatures of bond-directional anisotropy in both materials the different relative signs of Kitaev and Heisenberg interaction result in different deviations from the initial Kitaev model. Low-energy ferromagnetic fluctuations cannot be considered as a fingerprint of ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction.",

By establishing a general dissipative response theory applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian environments, we develop a protocol to access the dissipative spectrum (DS) through driven oscillation-dissipation resonance. We show that the DS can identify two-particle soft modes near quantum critical points and, on the normal-phase side, predict the emergence of macroscopic order exhibiting power-law growth following a dissipation quench. These distinctive signatures appear in quasiparticle-dominant regimes, previously considered trivial. Furthermore, we introduce extended dissipative susceptibilities that capture leading memory effects and demonstrate their utility in a dissipative fermionic model. Our results indicate that the DS is readily accessible and offers a versatile tool for probing equilibrium properties as well as predicting nonequilibrium dissipative dynamics.",

By cyclically coupling three hyperfine spin states via Raman and microwave fields, we impose a periodic boundary condition in the synthetic dimension, which together with a real-space ring trap, realizes a toroidal geometry with a synthetic magnetic flux. This flux induces azimuthal density modulations in the condensate, whose periodicity is uniquely determined by the quantized toroidal magnetic flux-a hallmark of the Hall torus geometry. By varying the relative phase between the couplings across repeated experimental runs, we control the location of the density extrema, emulating the behavior of Thouless charge pump in a toroidal geometry. We further investigate the onset of these modulations as the system transitions from a cylindrical to a toroidal topology.

This study explores the relationship between core and shell thicknesses and strain distribution in Ge/Si core/shell nanowires, targeting their application as hosts for spin qubits. Nanowires were synthesized using an Au-catalyzed chemical vapor deposition technique, achieving control over core and shell dimensions. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping confirmed structural integrity, while Geometric Phase Analysis and Raman spectroscopy provided quantitative insights into strain variations driven by core and shell dimensions. Furthermore, polarization resolved $μ$-Raman measurements allowed us to quantify the longitudinal and transverse phonon mode splitting as a function of strain in the Ge core. The strain dependent electronic properties were investigated by hole mobility measurements. Finally, we observe a record high hole mobility of 25,500 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, underscoring the potential of these core/shell nanowire structures for the realization of high-fidelity spin qubits. Our findings highlight the critical role of geometry in strain tuning and provide valuable design guidelines for optimizing Ge/Si nanowires in scalable quantum device architectures.",

        "abstract": "Final states comprising two or more top quarks are important search channels at the Large Hadron Collider for scalar particles predicted in models of physics beyond the Standard Model. While the di-top final state profits from a higher signal cross section, it can be subject to intricate interference patterns. Besides the interference with the large QCD background, in case of the presence of more than one high-mass scalar also large signal--signal interference contributions can occur. We show that in such scenarios it is crucial to account for loop-level mixing for obtaining accurate exclusion bounds. We demonstrate how the interference patterns can obscure the interpretation of possible deviations from the Standard Model expectations. We show that the four-top final state, while giving rise to a smaller signal cross section, provides important complementary information due to its much smaller signal--background interference contributions. Thus, the results obtained from the four-top final state can be instrumental for pinpointing the underlying new physics scenario.",

Within this framework, non-relativistic matter fields admit a covariant description, while the physical Newtonian dynamics is recovered through an immersion into the usual $3+1$ spacetime. By adopting a Gödel-like metric ansatz and coupling the gravitational field to a Galilean fluid derived from a variational principle, we obtain a system of highly nonlinear and coupled field equations. Exact solutions are constructed by fixing the matter sector consistently with the field equations. The resulting configurations describe rotating non-relativistic universes and satisfy $D(x)>H(x)$ throughout the entire spatial domain. As a consequence, the associated Killing vector remains spacelike everywhere and no closed timelike curves arise.",

        "abstract": "We argue that for finite energy windows, the final states in gravitational scattering in dimension $d > 4$ are normalizable coherent states in Fock space. However, as the center of the energy window goes to infinity, black hole physics predicts that these states become orthogonal to every state with a finite number of particles. Given that the spectral measure in energy is determined by Poincare invariance, the S-matrix cannot be a unitary operator in Fock space, despite having finite matrix elements in Fock space, and satisfying perturbative unitarity, to all orders in string perturbation theory. We identify regimes in the BFSS matrix model\\cite{bfss} and the definition of the S-matrix as the limit of CFT correlators\\cite{polchsuss}, which point to the same conclusion. We review a scattering theory based on the quantum mechanics of a finite number of fermionic oscillators, whose algebra formally converges to the Super-Poincare covariant Awada-Gibbons-Shaw\\cite{ags} algebra, and argue that a certain class of limiting states on that algebra satisfy all the properties required by physical unitarity in the algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics. The only missing ingredient for a consistent theory is a proof that the S matrix amplitudes themselves are Poincare invariant. We provide suggestive arguments, but no real proof, that this is so.",

The corresponding two-parameter family of regular background solutions of the classical equations of maximal supergravity in seven dimensions descends from maximal supergravity in eleven dimensions. We study the global and local stability properties of these solutions. We identify lines of zero-temperature first-order phase transitions, describing a polygon (a square) in the space of parameters, identified with the two fluxes. In the spectrum of fluctuations of the supergravity equations, interpreted as bound states of the dual, confining field theories, we find no evidence of local instabilities (tachyons). Over a significant portion of parameter space, that extends far away from the proximity to the transition, we identify an approximate dilaton, the mass of which is one order of magnitude smaller than the scale set by confinement. Our findings complement those emerging in other holographic models discussed in the literature, in which either the dilaton mass is only mildly lower than the confinement scale (when approaching a first-order transitions), or parametrically suppressed (when reaching the proximity to a second-order one).",

We show that, contrary to the expectation that the extra mass scale $m_e$ may bring an enhancement to the overall scaling, the amplitude turns out to start at $1/m_Z^6$ order, similarly to the $W$ boson mediated amplitude. The decay rate with both $W$ and $Z$ boson contributions is found to be $1.1\\cdot 10^{-80}$ eV, about 47 orders of magnitude smaller than previously estimated.

        "abstract": "Golden dark sirens - exceptionally well-localized gravitational-wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts - offer a powerful route to precision measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, with next-generation (XG) detectors. The statistical promise of this method, however, places stringent demands on waveform accuracy and detector calibration, as even small systematic errors can dominate over statistical uncertainties at high signal-to-noise ratios. We investigate the impact of waveform-modeling systematics on golden dark siren cosmology using a synthetic population of binary black holes consistent with current GW observations and analyzed in the XG-detector era. By comparing state-of-the-art waveform models against numerical-relativity-based reference signals, we quantify modeling inaccuracies from both modeling and data-analysis perspectives and assess how they propagate into biases in luminosity distance, host-galaxy association, and single-event $H_0$ inference. We find that while current waveform models often allow recovery of statistically consistent $H_0$ posteriors, small waveform-induced biases can significantly affect three-dimensional localization and host galaxy ranking, occasionally leading to incorrect redshift assignments. We further derive order-of-magnitude requirements on detector calibration accuracy needed to ensure that calibration systematics remain subdominant for golden dark sirens observed with XG networks. To realize sub-percent $H_0$ measurements with golden dark sirens will require waveform and calibration accuracies that scale as $\\mathcal{O}(ρ^{-2})$ with signal-to-noise ratio, motivating sustained advances in waveform modeling, numerical relativity, and detector calibration for the XG era.",

Far from mere rewritings, these provide compelling alternative frameworks, leading to immediate phenomenological applications. In this paper, we extend the playground to include the contributions of fermionic triangle loops, and use these results to compare the standard and higher-form realizations for two phenomenological processes: the pair production of two dark particles and the decay of a dark particle in two photons. Though they all do show some dependencies on the chosen realizations for the spin-zero or the spin-one dark states, we find that the two-photon mode is particularly sensitive and could actually be our prime window into the true nature of the dark field.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a renormalization-group invariant observable, the symmetry strength parameter $κ_{AB}$, for the quantitative characterization of symmetry breaking in QCD. As a first application, we employ $κ_{AB}$ to investigate the relative strength of $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry and $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry breaking in $N_f=2+1+1$ lattice QCD using optimal domain-wall fermions at the physical point. Our study covers three lattice spacings and twelve temperatures in the range 164-385~MeV. We examine three independent symmetry-breaking channels in the nonsinglet sector with connected correlators: the $U(1)_A$-sensitive scalar-pseudoscalar channel ($κ_{PS}$), probing the $π$-$δ$ system; the $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$-sensitive vector--axial-vector channel ($κ_{VA}$), probing the $ρ$-$a_1$ system; and an additional $U(1)_A$-sensitive tensor--axial-tensor channel ($κ_{TX}$), probing the $ρ$-$b_1$ system. At finite lattice spacing, we observe a clear hierarchy $κ_{PS} > κ_{TX} \\sim κ_{VA}$. A controlled continuum extrapolation reveals that this hierarchy collapses, with all three symmetry-breaking strengths becoming statistically indistinguishable within our precision. This result provides a new, model-independent benchmark from a chirally symmetric lattice action. Our findings indicate that the effective restoration scales for $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_A$ in the nonsinglet sector converge closely near the chiral crossover, placing stringent quantitative constraints on the temperature window for chiral and axial symmetry manifestation in connected channels. These results support a two-stage restoration scenario, in which full symmetry restoration -- including the singlet sector -- occurs only at significantly higher temperatures once topological fluctuations are suppressed.",

        "abstract": "We identify a fundamental tension between the standard formulation of CP violation and diffeomorphism invariance in general relativity. The effective Hamiltonian approach, while phenomenologically successful, relies on a preferred time foliation that is incompatible with general covariance. The CP-violating phases are scalars along the worldline of the decaying parent particle; however, the definition of masses and phases presupposes a local covariant structure, which becomes ill-defined near the origin where curvature is large and metric fluctuations become significant. We propose an information-geometric framework based on relative entropy, exploiting pure quantum states in particle and antiparticle Hilbert spaces. We show how the Sakharov conditions could be reinterpreted in terms of information-geometric quantities, although a fully rigorous phenomenological implementation remains to be developed.",

The observed $t\\bar{t}H(H\\rightarrow\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ cross section relative to its prediction from the standard model (SM) is $0.91\\,^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$. The observed (expected) results are compatible at the 95% confidence level with a $t\\bar{t}H(H\\rightarrow c\\bar{c})$ cross section that is at most 7.8 (8.7) times larger than the SM expectation.

Among these, the category consisting loop-extended seesaw frameworks is theoretically appealing but conventional discrete or continuous symmetries (\\emph{e.g.}, $U(1)$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_M$) cannot genuinely forbid the corresponding tree-level contributions, making loop dominance difficult to realize. We show that \\textit{non-invertible selection rules} (NISRs) naturally enforce the absence of tree-level terms while ensuring a dominant one-loop contribution. Intriguingly, the same non-invertible structure also stabilizes the dark matter candidate, providing a unified radiative origin of neutrino mass and dark sector stability. In particular, we focus on the T4-2-$i$ topology which embodies a type-II one-loop seesaw and demonstrate its natural realization from $Z_{7}$ Tambara--Yamagami (TY) fusion algebra.",

Hence, the resurgent structure of the non-BPS solutions turns out to be unexpectedly simple, and its resonance at the origin of the Borel plane even admits an analytic calculation of the normalization coefficients of their asymptotic forms to an arbitrary level of precision.",

We propose a ''reduction of order'' approach which is applied not at the level of equations of motion but only to initial data. This specifies uniquely the data for the unphysical modes in terms of the data for the physical modes. We argue that the apparent breaking of Lorentz invariance associated with this approach is not a problem provided one restricts to Lorentz frames for which the assumptions of effective field theory are manifestly valid.",

These results are relevant for argon-based experiments searching for dark matter in the form of low-mass Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, which are very sensitive to the modeling of the detector response in this energy range.",

We further analyzed the rephasing invariant structure of the FX phase $δ_{\\rm FX}$ under the approximation where the 1-3 element of the diagonalization matrix of charged leptons $U^{e}$ is neglected, $U_{13}^{e} = 0$. As a result, in the limit where the 1-3 element of diagonalization of neutrinos $U^ν$ is also neglected, we obtained a compact expression for the FX phase $δ_{\\rm FX} = \\arg [ { U^{e}_{11} U^{e}_{12} U^{e}_{33} } { U^{ν*}_{11} U^{ν*}_{12} U^{ν*}_{33} / \\det U^{e} \\det U^{ν*} } ] - \\arg [ 1 + ({U^{e *}_{23} U^ν_{23} / U^{e *}_{33} U^ν_{33}} ) ] $. In this limit, the FX phase is controlled by two independent relative phases between $U^{ν, e}$, and the FX phase for finite $U_{13}^ν$ is understood as a generalization to the compact expression.",

Furthermore, we prove that the linear independence of the X-stabilizer generators together with the commutativity condition modulo a power of two ensures the existence of transversal implementations of all logical Pauli Z rotations with discrete angles in general CSS codes. Our results identify a canonical homological obstruction governing transversal implementability and provide a conceptual foundation for a formal theory of transversal structures in quantum error correction.",

Our calculations determine a critical flavor number of $N_f^c=6.81$ which marks the chiral symmetry restoration of quarks. Further analysis reveals the critical exponents of the chiral condensate as $ -\\langle\\barψ ψ\\rangle\\sim |N_f-N_f^c|^{0.53(9)}$, characterized the second order feature of this phase transition of chiral symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications for the walking regime towards the conformal window at larger flavor.",

        "abstract": "Lattice simulations of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) enable one to calculate the low-energy properties of the strong interaction among quarks and gluons based on the first principle. The most time-consuming part of the numerical simulations of lattice QCD is typically solving a linear equation for the quark matrix. In particular, a discretized quark formulation called the domain-wall fermion operator requires a high numerical cost, while retaining the lattice version of the chiral symmetry to good precision. The domain-wall operator is defined on a five-dimensional (5D) space extending the four-dimensional (4D) spacetime with an extra fifth coordinate. After solving the linear equation in 5D space, the result vector is projected onto the original 4D space. There is a variant of the domain-wall operator that improves the convergence of the 5D linear equation while unchanging the 4D solution vector. In this paper, we examine how this variant of the domain-wall operator accelerates the iterative linear equation solver in practical setups. We also measure the eigenvalues of the operator and compare the condition number with the convergence of the solver. We use a generic lattice QCD code set Bridge++ that is planned to be released including the improved form of the domain-wall operator examined in this work with code for the GPU.",

Since the emergence of GPUs for general-purpose, mixed-precision algorithms that combine single-precision (FP32) with double-precision (FP64) arithmetics have become widely used in this field and others. While FP32-based methods are now well established, we examine the practicality of using FP16. In this work, we introduce rescaling steps in both the outer iterative refinement step and the inner BiCGStab solver to avoid numerical instability. In our experiments with a simple Wilson kernel, the solver shows improved stability, and the additional iteration count compared to the FP64 version remains within 20\\%, indicating that the FP16 version is practical for use. We believe that the proposed rescaling methods can also benefit other mixed precision preconditioners in avoiding underflows.",

The emergence of a minimum length scale, dictated by the degree of noncommutativity, induces a behavioral transition in the HSC and establishes a lower bound. In the large noncommutativity regime, the qualitative features of the complexity deviate significantly from the commutative case. The HFS is shown to provide an effective measure of the degree of noncommutativity. Although the HSC generally satisfies strong subadditivity, this property fails abruptly when the subregion size approaches the minimum length scale. At finite temperature, the long-range behavior of the HSC is modified, and its lower bound scales positively with temperature. Furthermore, temperature enhances the sensitivity of the fidelity susceptibility to the degree of noncommutativity. Within the AdS soliton background, a competition between connected and disconnected configurations arises in the HSC, signaling a phase-transition-like behavior. Finally, the compactification scale is found to diminish the sensitivity of the HFS to the degree of noncommutativity.",

By tracking the superconducting energy gap, we show that approaching the quantum critical point (QCP) closes the gap and induces incipient insulating features, indicating that enhanced quantum fluctuations suppress superconducting order and trigger the SIT. To probe the transition, we employ two holographic indicators: holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), the latter being a mixed-state entanglement measure. In contrast to HEE, which for sufficiently large configuration is dominated by the thermal entropy and is therefore largely insensitive to entanglement along the temperature direction, EWCS displays pronounced critical scaling and provides a robust diagnostic of the quantum phase transition (QPT). We attribute this contrast to the fact that HEE at large scales is controlled by the infrared (IR) geometry, whereas EWCS is governed by deformations of the entire bulk. Our results establish EWCS as a robust probe of holographic quantum criticality in mixed states.",

We establish the primary HEFT (pHEFT) as a benchmark framework, demonstrating that alternative HEFT constructions can be systematically derived from it. A key advantage of the pHEFT construction is its parameter choice, which maintains linear relations between the UV Lagrangian parameters and squared heavy masses. By strictly employing the inverse squared heavy masses as the expansion parameters without imposing additional constraints, pHEFT preserves maximal ultraviolet (UV) information and ensures higher perturbative accuracy by avoiding the additional truncations inherent in more complex, non-linear formulations or extra constraints. Through the analysis of the $Z_2$-symmetric real singlet model and the 2HDM, we illustrate the criteria for identifying viable primary HEFT constructions in UV models with scalar extensions. Furthermore, for the first time, we derive the HEFT operators of the RHTM involving fermions.",

Our results agree with recent lattice QCD calculations and we obtain $\\mathcal{C}_g(t)$ with a comparable statistical precision to lattice QCD.

Within this formalism, we explicitly present a simple algebraic construction for the gauge invariant extended Maxwell actions that avoids explicit index manipulations up to mass dimension six.

        "abstract": "The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) algorithm is one of the most promising implementations of the variational quantum eigensolver for quantum computers. However, for large systems, the number of UCC factors leads to deep quantum circuits, which are prohibitive for execution on quantum hardware. To address this, circuit depth can be reduced at the cost of more measurements with a Taylor series expansion of UCC factors with small angles, while treating the large-angle factors exactly. We implement this approach to quadratic order (qUCC) for systems with strong correlations and systems where conventional methods like coupled cluster (CC) with low excitation levels fail, but UCC and qUCC perform well. We study hydrogen chains and the BeH2 molecule that allow us to change the degree of strong correlation due to geometrical distortions. We show, via a dramatic increase in number of factors able to handle exactly, a systematic convergence of these results as more exact UCC factors are included in the calculations -- the hardest to converge regime is in the crossover from weak to strong coupling. In all cases the total number of UCC factors needed to be treated exactly is much less than the total number of UCC factors available (typically about one-third to one-half of the total number of factors).",

        "abstract": "The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading approach for combinatorial optimization on near-term quantum devices, yet its scalability is limited by the difficulty of optimizing \\(2p\\) variational parameters for a large number \\(p\\) of layers. Recent empirical studies indicate that optimal QAOA angles exhibit concentration and transferability across problem sizes. Leveraging this observation, we propose a schedule-learning framework that transfers spectral-gap-informed adiabatic control strategies from small-scale instances to larger systems. Our method extracts the spectral gap profile of small problems and constructs a continuous schedule governed by \\(\\partial_t s = κg^q(s)\\), where \\(g(s)\\) is the instantaneous gap and \\((κ, q)\\) are global hyperparameters. Discretizing this schedule yields closed-form expressions for all QAOA angles, reducing the classical optimization task from \\(2p\\) parameters to only \\(2\\), independent of circuit depth. This drastic parameter compression mitigates classical optimization overhead and reduces sensitivity to barren plateau phenomena. Numerical simulations on random QUBO and 3-regular MaxCut instances demonstrate that the learnt schedules transfer effectively to larger systems while achieving competitive approximation ratios. Our results suggest that gap-informed schedule transfers provide a scalable and parameter-efficient strategy for QAOA.",

We analytically establish that in the presence of an absorber, the average absorption time of the quantum walker is finite, contrary to the behavior of a classical random walker, indicating an infinite resource reduction on moving over to a quantum version of a walker. Furthermore, numerical simulations indicate a reversal of this behavior due to the insertion of disorder in the walker's step lengths. Additionally, we demonstrate that in the presence of an absorber, there is a speed-up in the spreading rate, and that a disordered quantum walk that is sub-ballistic regains the ballistic spreading of a clean quantum walk.",

        "abstract": "Portfolio optimization under strict cardinality constraints is a combinatorial challenge that defies classical convex optimization techniques, particularly in the context of \"Direct Indexing\" and ESG-constrained mandates. In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) offers a promising hybrid approach. However, standard QAOA implementations utilizing transverse field mixers often fail to strictly enforce hard constraints, necessitating soft penalties that distort the energy landscape. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a constraint-preserving QAOA formulation against Simulated Annealing (SA) and Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP). We implement a specific QAOA ansatz utilizing a Dicke state initialization and an XY-mixer Hamiltonian that strictly preserves the Hamming weight of the solution, ensuring only valid portfolios of size K are explored. Furthermore, we introduce a Trotterized parameter initialization schedule inspired by adiabatic quantum computing to mitigate the \"Barren Plateau\" problem. Backtesting on a basket of 10 US equities over 2025 reveals that our QAOA approach achieves a Sharpe Ratio of 1.81, significantly outperforming Simulated Annealing (1.31) and HRP (0.98). We further analyze the operational implications of the algorithm's high turnover (76.8%), discussing the trade-offs between theoretical optimality and implementation costs in institutional settings.",

        "abstract": "We revisit the localization tensor (LT) from geometric and probabilistic perspectives and construct extensions that are naturally compatible with periodic boundary conditions (PBC), without redefining the position operator. In open boundary conditions, we show that the LT can be written exactly as the covariance of a bivariate probability distribution built from density-density correlations. This leads to two conceptually distinct extensions to PBC: (i) a geometric one based on the Riemannian center (Frechet mean) on the circle, and (ii) a metric-free one based on the mutual information I, which treats the configuration space purely as a probability space. We then relate the LT to the static structure factor by identifying the diagonal part, Cpp, as a \"localization function\" C(p), whose small-momentum behavior determines the LT in the thermodynamic limit. This clarifies why the LT is sensitive to transitions out of the extended phase but by itself cannot distinguish Anderson-type localization from dimerization: both share the same low-momentum asymptotics. We show that the finite-momentum behavior of C(p), together with an inverse participation ratio (IPR)-based upper bound valid in localized phases, provides a sharp criterion that discriminates localization from dimerization. These results are illustrated on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Aubry-Andre models, with and without interactions, and suggest that structure factor-based probes offer robust and experimentally accessible diagnostics of localized and dimerized phases under PBC.",

In the context of the SU(1,1) group, sub-Planck features have been constructed through the superposition of four Perelomov coherent states on the hyperbolic plane (the SU(1,1) compass state). However, these structures differ in scale along different phase-space directions, resulting in nonuniform sensitivity enhancement. We overcome this limitation by constructing $\\overline{n}$-component compass states, which are obtained by superposing $\\overline{n} \\geq 6$ SU(1,1) coherent states, with an even total number, evenly arranged along a circular path on the hyperbolic plane; that is, all components lie at the same distance from the origin and have equal angular spacing of $\\frac{2π}{\\overline{n}}$. These generalized SU(1,1) compass states generate circularly shaped sub-Planck features (isotropic sub-Planckness) and provide uniform enhancement in sensitivity to phase-space displacements. As the number of coherent states $\\overline{n}$ increases, these refinements progressively improve. While verified for $\\overline{n} = 16$ SU(1,1) coherent states, the results remain valid for superpositions with arbitrarily large $\\overline{n}$ components.",

        "abstract": "We study quantum repeater chains in which entangled links between neighbouring nodes are created through heralded entanglement generation and adjacent links are swapped as soon as possible. Since heralded entanglement generation attempts succeed only probabilistically, some links will have to be stored in quantum memories at the nodes of the chain while waiting for adjacent links to be generated. The fidelity of these stored links decreases with time due to decoherence, and if they are stored for too long then this can lead to low end-to-end fidelity. Previous work has shown that the end-to-end fidelity can be improved by deterministically discarding links when their ages exceed some cutoff value. Such deterministic cutoff policies provide strict control of the fidelity of all links, but they come at the expense of having to track link ages. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic cutoff policy that does not require tracking link ages, at the cost of abandoning strict control of the fidelity. We benchmark this new probabilistic cutoff policy against a deterministic cutoff policy. We compare the policies in terms of the end-to-end rate and fidelity, and the secret-key rate. We find that even though the probabilistic cutoff policy keeps track of less state, it can provide secret-key rates of the same order of magnitude as the deterministic cutoff policy in chains with few nodes or high elementary link generation probabilities.

Experimental demonstrations have so far focused on isolated devices or simple cascaded devices configurations. Here, we experimentally realize and characterize a network of two coupled photonic quantum memristors with crossed feedback, implemented on a silicon nitride photonic integrated circuit and fed by a room-temperature single-photon source based on a silicon-vacancy color center SiV$^-$ in a nanodiamond. Each memristor consists of an integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer whose transfer function is adaptively updated by photon detection events on another memristor, thus generating novel non-Markovian input-output dynamics with an enhanced memristive behaviour compared to single devices. In particular, we report inter-memristor input-output hysteresis curves exhibiting larger form factors and displaying self-intersecting loops, respectively revealing marked bistability and topologically non-trivial memory dynamics. Furthermore, numerical simulations show how these features emerge from the interplay between memory depth and relative input phase, for both intra- and inter-memristor input-output relations. Our results establish coupled integrated photonic quantum memristors as scalable nonlinear building blocks and highlight their potential for implementing compact quantum neuromorphic and reservoir computing architectures.",

These include projections of bipartite positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices onto the set of PSD matrices with a given marginal, and projections of ensembles of PSD matrices onto the set of PSD decompositions of a given matrix, with important special cases corresponding to projections onto the set of quantum channels (via the Choi isomorphism) and onto the set of measurements. We introduce prior-channel decompositions of completely positive (CP) maps, which uniquely decompose any CP map into a prior PSD matrix and a quantum channel. This decomposition generalizes the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism by establishing a bijective correspondence between arbitrary bipartite PSD matrices and channel-state pairs, and we show that it arises naturally from the fidelity projections developed here. As applications, we show that the pretty good measurement - associated with a weighted ensemble - is the fidelity projection of the ensemble onto the set of measurements, and that the Petz recovery map - associated with a reference state and forward channel - is the projection of a CP map (constructed from the channel-state pair) onto the set of reverse quantum channels, thereby recasting the well-known identification of the Petz map with quantum Bayes' rule in information-geometric terms. Our results also provide an information-geometric underpinning of the Leifer-Spekkens quantum state over time formalism [Leifer and Spekkens, Phys. Rev. A 88, 052130 (2013)].",

While optimal decoding is generally NP-hard, we propose a faster decoder exploiting the structural properties of the underlying graph states. Although distinct error patterns may yield the same syndrome, we demonstrate that the post-measurement state follows a well-defined structure determined by the projective syndrome measurement. Building on this idea, we introduce a hierarchical decoder in which each level can be solved in polynomial time. Additionally, this decoder achieves optimal decoding performance at the lower levels of the hierarchy. This strategy avoids the need for full maximum-likelihood decoding of graph codes. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Spurious couplings and decoherence degrade the performance of solid-state quantum processors, demanding careful design, calibration, and mitigation protocols. These strategies often rely on characterization of the idling processor, but tomographic recovery of (time-independent) Lindblad dynamics scales exponentially with qubit count. Here, we experimentally benchmark and demonstrate that randomized (\"shadow\") measurements accelerate Lindblad tomography on a superconducting transmon processor. We first implement extensible Lindblad tomography, which estimates Lindblad parameters using a complete tomographic dataset, and use it as a baseline to benchmark a shadow tomography approach, shadow Lindblad tomography. The shadow approach recycles randomized configurations to estimate the same Lindblad parameters using far fewer resources under physically motivated locality assumptions. We experimentally verify these assumptions in our processor by implementing the protocols on one- and three-qubit subsystems; here, shadow Lindblad tomography reproduces extensible Lindblad tomography within uncertainties while using exponentially fewer configurations. Leveraging this efficiency, we apply shadow Lindblad tomography to the full five-qubit processor and recover all single qubit dissipation and two-qubit coupling parameters in 9 hours of acquisition time compared to an estimated 58 hours for extensible Lindblad tomography. Additionally, our shadow implementation is compatible with conventional Gaussian error propagation, avoiding the use of median-of-means estimators. Together, these results demonstrate how randomized shadow tomography protocols can be practically implemented to learn quantum processor dynamics at an increasing qubit count.",

In this work, we propose an effective and experimentally feasible scheme to significantly enhance the simultaneous quantum estimation of the photon magnon and magnon mechanical coupling strengths in a hybrid cavity magnon mechanical platform. Our approach relies on the assistance of a coherent feedback loop combined with the injection of a coherent driving field. We show that an appropriate tuning of the system and feedback parameters leads to a substantial reduction of the estimation errors associated with both coupling strengths. To quantify the metrological performance of the proposed scheme, we employ the quantum Cramer Rao bound (QCRB) as a fundamental benchmark for multiparameter estimation. We explicitly compute and compare the QCRBs derived from the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) formalisms. Our results demonstrate that the RLD based QCRB is systematically lower than the SLD based bound, indicating superior estimation precision in the considered noncommutative estimation scenario. We further analyze the performance of heterodyne detection and show that, in suitable parameter regimes, the corresponding classical estimation precision closely approaches the ultimate quantum limit predicted by our scheme. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed setup within currently available cavity magnon mechanical platforms. Owing to its general character, the framework developed here can be readily extended to the high precision estimation of other physical parameters in hybrid quantum systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an introduction to geometric representations of quantum states in which each distinct quantum state, pure and mixed, corresponds to a unique point in a Euclidean space. Beginning with a review of some underappreciated properties of the most commonly used geometric representation, the Bloch sphere visualization of qubit states, we show how concepts, algorithms, and spatial relations viewable on this geometric representation can be extended to representations of qudit states of any finite quantum dimension $d$ and on to the infinite-dimensional limit. A primary goal of the work is helping the reader develop a visual intuition of these spaces, which can complement the understanding of the algebraic formalism of quantum mechanics for learners, teachers, and researchers at any level. Particular emphasis is given both to understanding states in a basis-independent way and to understanding how probability amplitudes and density matrix elements used to algebraically represent states in a particular basis correspond to line segments and angles in the geometric representations. In addition to providing visualizations for such concepts as superpositions, mixtures, decoherence, and measurement, we demonstrate how the representations can be used to substitute simple geometrical calculations for more cumbersome linear algebra ones, which may be of particular use in introducing mixed states and density matrices to beginning quantum students at an early stage. The work concludes with the geometrical interpretation of some commonly used metrics such as the purity of states and their relation to real, Euclidean vectors in the infinite-dimensional limit of the space, which contains all lower-dimensional qudit spaces as subspaces.",

        "abstract": "Biomarker-based prediction of clinical outcomes is challenging due to nonlinear relationships, correlated features, and the limited size of many medical datasets. Classical machine-learning methods can struggle under these conditions, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC), using both noiseless emulation and hardware execution on the neutral-atom Rydberg processor \\textit{Aquila}. We evaluate performance with six classical machine-learning models and use SHAP to generate feature subsets. We find that models trained on emulated quantum features achieve mean test accuracies comparable to those trained on classical features, but have higher training accuracies and greater variability over data splits, consistent with overfitting. When comparing hardware execution of QRC to noiseless emulation, the models are more robust over different data splits and often exhibit statistically significant improvements in mean test accuracy. This combination of improved accuracy and increased stability is suggestive of a regularising effect induced by hardware execution. To investigate the origin of this behaviour, we examine the statistical differences between hardware and emulated quantum feature distributions. We find that hardware execution applies a structured, time-dependent transformation characterised by compression toward the mean and a progressive reduction in mutual information relative to emulation.",

Recent advances in quantum machine learning have motivated hybrid quantum-classical extensions aimed at enhancing representational capacity while remaining compatible with near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we investigate trainable embedding strategies within quantum-assisted PINNs for solving parabolic PDEs, using one- and two-dimensional heat equations as canonical benchmarks. We introduce two quantum-assisted architectures that differ in their embedding components. In the first approach, a classical feed-forward neural network generates trainable feature maps for quantum data encoding (FNN-TE-QPINN). In the second, the embedding stage is realized entirely by a parameterized quantum circuit (QNN-TE-QPINN), yielding a fully quantum feature map. Our findings emphasize the critical role of embedding design and support hybrid quantum-classical approaches for parabolic PDE modeling in the NISQ era.",

In this approach, system dynamics is represented as a linear combination of a predefined set of basis functions, and the corresponding coefficients are sparsely estimated from observed time-series data. In this study, we propose sparse identification of quantum Hamiltonian dynamics (SIQHDy), a SINDy-inspired quantum circuit learning framework for estimating quantum Hamiltonian dynamics from time-series data of quantum measurement outcomes. In SIQHDy, the unitary evolution of a quantum Hamiltonian system is expressed as a product of basis quantum circuits, and the corresponding circuit parameters are estimated through sparsity-promoting optimization. We numerically demonstrate that SIQHDy accurately reconstructs the dynamics of single-, three-, and five-spin systems, and exhibits robustness to measurement noise in the three-spin case. Furthermore, we propose an extension of SIQHDy for scenarios with limited accessible observables and evaluate its performance in identifying two-spin systems and in network-structure identification for five-spin systems.",

        "abstract": "Solving coupled systems of differential equations (DEs) is a central problem across scientific computing. While Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a promising, mesh-free approach, their standard architectures struggle with the multi-objective optimization conflicts and local optima traps inherent in coupled problems. To address the first issue, we propose a Forked PINN (FPINN) framework designed for coupled systems of DEs. FPINN employs a shared base network with independent branches, isolating gradient pathways to stabilize training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FPINN in simulating non-Markovian open quantum dynamics governed by coupled DEs, where multi-objective conflicts and local optima traps often cause evolutionary stagnation. To overcome this second challenge, we incorporate an evolution regularization loss that guides the model away from trivial solutions and ensures physically meaningful evolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FPINN in simulating non-Markovian open quantum dynamics governed by coupled DEs, where multi-objective conflicts and local optima traps often cause evolutionary stagnation. For the spin-boson and XXZ models, FPINN accurately captures hallmark non-Markovian features, such as quantum coherence revival and information backflow, significantly outperforming standard PINNs. The proposed FPINN architecture offers a general and effective framework for solving coupled systems of equations, which arise across a broad spectrum from classical physics to modern artificial intelligence, including applications in multi-body rotational dynamics, multi-asset portfolio optimization, chemical reaction kinetics, and deep representation learning.",

For statistical (stochastic) optical fields, and under an operational stance where outcomes are not assumed pre-assigned prior to detection, suitably prepared two-beam polarization states can exhibit Bell--CHSH correlations of quantum strength. The same platform offers a tunable, low-cost testbed for stress-testing Bell/CHSH and contextuality witnesses under realistic imperfections (noise, coarse binning, selective sampling). We also outline an alternative preparation based on external conical refraction (ECR), where engineered intersecting conical-refraction rings mimic the intersecting emission cones of SPDC. We give a self-contained categorical formulation: the preparation-and-conditioning pipeline (Hadamard-like splitting, CNOT-like coupling, and routing/conditioning that removes unwanted contributions) is treated as a single morphism in an operational process theory (e.g. $\\mathbf{CPM}(\\mathbf{FHilb})$). From it we functorially extract an empirical model, i.e. a compatible family of context-indexed probability distributions. The Abramsky--Brandenburger sheaf criterion then applies: noncontextuality is the existence of a global section, and CHSH violation is a precise failure-to-glue. This separates kinematic nonseparability from operational contextuality and clarifies why neither, by itself, entails nonlocal causation; contextuality can arise in a classically implementable stochastic-optics regime.",

The identification of quantum uncertainties with actual stochastic fluctuations, a standard aspect of the current physical account for the emergence of the cosmic structure, is called into question.

In contrast to standard cavity quantum electrodynamics with its electric-dipole coupling of the electric field operators with matter, here it is the quantized magnetic field of an LC-resonator which is coupled to the angular momentum of particles. Adding the Josephson junction (JJ) to the linear LC circuit allows us to explore nonlinear flux-matter phases and sector-selective photon dressing in regimes relevant to circuit QED and mesoscopic rings. Furthermore, we consider the tight-binding systems that exhibit a tunable nonlinearity representing artificial JJ, but without actual JJs included in the circuit.",

        "abstract": "Recent experiments on donor-based spin qubits in silicon have leveraged the exchange interaction between electrons bound to separate donor nuclei to perform two-qubit operations. A consistently observed yet unexplained phenomenon in such systems is the significant increase in electron readout contrast, measured via Elzerman-style readout to a single-electron transistor (SET) island, when the donor nuclei are initialized in a parallel spin orientation compared to an anti-parallel orientation. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the exchange-coupled donor system in the parallel nuclear regime and propose a physical mechanism for this effect. We attribute the enhanced readout contrast to an additional electron tunneling event to the SET during a single read period, when the donor nuclei are aligned in a parallel spin configuration. These insights inform strategies for improving electron readout fidelity in these systems and contribute to a more complete understanding of spin-dependent tunnelling processes in donor-based qubit architectures.",

We derive closed-form expressions for the quantum Fisher information matrix, establishing that metrological performance depends solely on the thermal visibility $\\mathcal{V}(β)$ and its derivative. The output state remains diagonal in photon-number basis, making photon counting globally optimal and saturating the multiparameter quantum Cramér-Rao bound without adaptive feedback. Moving beyond ideal unitary evolution, we analyze protocol robustness under concurrent amplitude and phase damping. Using Fisher Information Susceptibility, we establish a clear hierarchy: NOON states offer maximal theoretical sensitivity but exhibit exponential fragility to loss, rendering them impractical. Squeezed vacuum states emerge as robust candidates for steady-state sensing, while cat states prove compelling for transient thermometry by retaining significant coherence after photon loss. We validate these predictions through digital quantum circuit implementation on IBM's \\texttt{ibm_torino} processor. Experimental results confirm the predicted Fisher information landscape while revealing systematic noise-induced biases, demonstrating that current NISQ hardware can effectively benchmark fundamental trade-offs in multiparameter quantum sensing.",

        "abstract": "Networked quantum sensors have several applications such as the mapping of magnetic fields. When the magnetic fields are biomagnetic ones, i.e., they contain some private information, the information of from who non-zero magnetic fields occur has to be protected from eavesdroppers. Anonymous quantum sensing keeps it secret by estimating amplitudes of the magnetic fields without disclosing the positions of non-zero magnetic fields. In this paper, we propose an anonymous quantum sensing protocol that is robust against any independent noise in state preparations. To this end, we devise a quantum state verification protocol for a superposition of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Dicke states and combine it with the original protocol of anonymous quantum sensing. Our verification protocol can decide whether the fidelity between the ideal and actual states is high or low more efficiently than the direct fidelity estimation. Since the original protocol of anonymous quantum sensing cannot correctly estimate the amplitudes of the magnetic fields under state preparation errors, our results would improve the performance of anonymous quantum sensing in realistic situations.",

This Lie Infinity-algebra reduces to a Lie 2-algebra L^2 (M, $ω$) when (M, $ω$) is 2-plectic. Following ideas of N.L. Delgado [Del18], we introduce the Lie 2-algebra D^2 (M, $ω$), which generalises the Lie 2-algebra L^2 (M, $ω$) and its extension containing Hamiltonian pairs. Given a two-plectic manifold (M, $ω$) and a Lie 2-algebra g_1 $\\oplus$ g_0 acting on M we define a comomentum map as a lift of the action, i.e., as a Lie 2-algebra morphism from g_1 $\\oplus$ g_0 to the extension of the Lie 2-algebra D^2 (M, $ω$).

He poses the question of whether analogous canonical $L_\\infty$-morphisms exist in higher degrees -- namely, for any standard higher Courant algebroid twisted by a closed $(r+1)$-form. We adfirmatively answer this question, presenting a general framework that naturally yields such canonical $L_\\infty$-morphisms for arbitrary $r$, while at the same time clarifying the geometrical and homotopical structures underlying the construction. We also show how this framework accommodates the canonical morphism between Roger's observable $L_\\infty$-algebra of a pre-$r$-plectic manifold and the higher Courant algebra described by Zambon and one of the authors in \"Observables on multisymplectic manifolds and higher Courant algebroids\" [arXiv:2209.05836].",

        "abstract": "We study Gaussian concentration inequalities for random fields obtained as finitary codings of i.i.d.\\ processes, establishing a natural bridge between finitary codings and concentration inequalities. A finitary coding formalizes how a random field with nontrivial dependence, such as the Ising model, can be generated from an i.i.d.\\ source by a shift-equivariant map that determines each output spin from a finite, configuration-dependent window of the input. Gaussian concentration yields uniform sub-Gaussian fluctuation bounds for all local observables. Our main abstract result shows that Gaussian concentration is preserved under finitary codings of i.i.d.\\ fields provided the coding volume has finite second moment. The proof relies on a refinement of the classical worst-case bounded-differences inequality of Talagrand and Marton, allowing us to exploit configuration-dependent bounds. Under an additional structural condition that we call the short-range factorization property, satisfied in particular by codings constructed via coupling-from-the-past algorithms, finite first moment of the coding volume already suffices. These moment conditions are sharp. Applications include Gibbs measures and Markov random fields on $\\mathbb Z^d$, probabilistic cellular automata, and one-dimensional stochastic processes. For classical lattice models such as the Ising, Potts, and random-cluster models, we obtain sharp criteria for Gaussian concentration coinciding with uniqueness regimes. For countable-state Markov chains, we derive equivalent characterizations, including geometric ergodicity, exponential return-time tails, and the existence of finitary i.i.d.\\ codings with exponential tails.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the effects of the 2019 universalization of Mexico's Social Pension Program (PAM), one of the country's most expansive and politically salient social programs. The reform simultaneously increased the cash transfer and extended eligibility to all individuals aged 65 and over, regardless of income or contributory pension status. Using nationally representative data from the ENIGH and a triple-differences (DDD) identification strategy, we estimate the causal effect of the universalization on poverty and labor market outcomes. Our empirical approach exploits variation across time (pre- and post-reform), age (eligible vs. ineligible), and pension scheme status (non-contributory vs. contributory), allowing us to separate the effects of expanded eligibility from those of increased benefit levels. We find strong increases in take-up rates and no significant change in overall poverty rates, suggesting that many new beneficiaries were not economically vulnerable. However, we document a surprising increase in extreme poverty, concentrated among low-income elderly who responded to the reform by exiting the labor force. This reduction in labor supply, driven by a significant drop in employment among individuals in the bottom income quartile, suggests that the pension acted as a substitute for labor income rather than a supplement. Taken together, the results highlight the trade-offs inherent in universal pension programs: while broader access reduces administrative exclusion, extending transfers to economically secure individuals may dilute redistributive impacts and generate behavioral responses that offset potential welfare gains.",

And even when hitched to a social reference point, a fully decisive and immediate response is invariably assumed. In this paper, we propose a non-standard articulation of the trade-off between personal utility and social distance, one motivated by experimental evidence from psychology, management science, and economics. Our approach deconstructs non-recurrent consumer choice to two stages: a non-decisive first stage in which a binary relation, called one-many ordering, yields an interval, the consideration set, to which the deferred choice is confined; a decisive second stage in which the distance from the average social choice, and future social expectations, are taken into account in present utility. Finally, we embed this indecisive consumer in an exploratory game-theoretic setting, and show that indecisiveness and choice deferral may cause social loss.",

Using quadratic vector autoregressions as a laboratory, we show that linear local projections fail to capture any nonlinearities when shocks are symmetrically distributed. Popular state-dependent local projections specifications capture distinct aspects of nonlinearity: those interacting shocks with their signs capture higher-order effects, while those interacting shocks with lagged states capture state dependence. However, their gains over linear specifications are concentrated in tail shocks or tail states; and, for lag-based specifications, hinge on how well the chosen observable proxies the latent state. Our proposed specification-which augments the linear specification with a squared shock term and an interaction between the shock and lagged observables-best approximates the true responses across the entire joint distribution of shocks and states. An application to monetary policy reveals economically meaningful state dependence, whereas higher-order effects, though statistically significant, prove economically modest.",

        "abstract": "Sensitivity analysis is widely used to assess the robustness of causal conclusions in observational studies, yet its interaction with the structure of measured covariates is often overlooked. When latent confounders cannot be directly adjusted for and are instead controlled using proxy variables, strong associations between exposure and measured proxies can amplify sensitivity to residual confounding. We formalize this phenomenon in linear regression settings by showing that a simple ratio involving the exposure model coefficient and residual exposure variance provides an observable measure of this increased sensitivity. Applying our framework to smoking and lung cancer, we document how growing socioeconomic stratification in smoking behavior over time leads to heightened sensitivity to unmeasured confounding in more recent data. These results highlight the importance of multicollinearity when interpreting sensitivity analyses based on proxy adjustment.",

Using monthly data for 67 Shanghai-listed A-H dual-listed firms from January 2011 to May 2019, we estimate a dynamic panel model with two-step system GMM to account for premium persistence and potential endogeneity. Market efficiency is proxied by trading-friction measures derived from daily high-low price ranges. We find that the implementation of SHHK is associated with an average 18.4% increase in the A-H premium. However, this effect is heterogeneous. The marginal policy impact is stronger for firms operating in less efficient markets and weaker for those with higher efficiency, indicating that pre-existing trading frictions condition the policy outcome. We find no significant response at the announcement stage. Placebo tests and alternative efficiency measures confirm the robustness of the efficiency-dependent effect. Overall, the results highlight the role of the information environment in shaping liberalization outcomes.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) constraint on a regularized mean-variance (MV) portfolio optimization problem in a large-dimensional setting, in which a positive definite regularization matrix is imposed on the sample covariance matrix. We first derive the asymptotic results for the out-of-sample (OOS) Sharpe ratio (SR) of the proposed portfolio, which help quantify the impact of imposing an ESG-level constraint as well as the effect of estimation error arising from the sample mean estimation of the assets' ESG score. Furthermore, to study the influence of the choices of the regularization matrix, we develop an estimator for the OOS Sharpe ratio. The corresponding asymptotic properties of the Sharpe ratio estimator are established based on random matrix theory. Simulation results show that the proposed estimators perform close to the corresponding oracle level. Moreover, we numerically investigate the impact of various forms of regularization matrices on the OOS SR, which provides useful guidance for practical implementation. Finally, based on OOS SR estimator, we propose an adaptive regularized portfolio which uses the best regularization matrix yielding the highest estimated SR (among a set of candidates) at each decision node. Empirical evidence based on the S\\&P 500 index demonstrates that the proposed adaptive ESG-constrained portfolio achieves a high OOS SR while satisfying the required ESG level, offering a practically effective approach for sustainable investment.",

        "abstract": "Financial structures such as securitisations, insurance contracts, and other hierarchical claims systems can be interpreted as deterministic allocation mechanisms acting on stochastic inflow processes. This paper develops a general computational representation of such structures by separating the stochastic generation of inflows from the deterministic rules governing their distribution across positions. Allocation rules, trigger conditions, and priority relations are expressed as explicit, state-dependent operators mapping realised inflows to payments under each scenario. This representation enables financial structures to be analysed as computable economic systems whose performance and risk characteristics can be evaluated consistently across alternative configurations within a unified stochastic environment. While motivated by applications in structured finance, the framework applies more broadly to contractual and institutional arrangements in which uncertain resources are allocated across ordered claims. By providing a unified computational architecture for representing and comparing such mechanisms, the approach supports systematic analysis of structural design, risk distribution, and contractual transparency under uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) techniques are applied for pricing and hedging representative financial instruments of increasing complexity. We compare standard Monte Carlo (MC) vs QMC results using Sobol' low discrepancy sequences, different sampling strategies, and various analyses of performance. We find that QMC outperforms MC in most cases, including the highest-dimensional simulations, showing faster and more stable convergence. Regarding greeks computation, we compare standard approaches, based on finite differences (FD) approximations, with adjoint methods (AAD) providing evidences that, when the number of greeks is small, the FD approach combined with QMC can lead to the same accuracy as AAD, thanks to increased convergence rate and stability, thus saving a lot of implementation effort while keeping low computational cost. Using GSA, we are able to fully explain our findings in terms of reduced effective dimension of QMC simulation, allowed in most cases, but not always, by Brownian Bridge discretization or PCA construction. We conclude that, beyond pricing, QMC is a very effcient technique also for computing risk measures, greeks in particular, as it allows to reduce the computational effort of high dimensional Monte Carlo simulations typical of modern risk management.",

        "abstract": "Individual-level epidemic models are increasingly being used to help understand the transmission dynamics of various infectious diseases. However, fitting such models to individual-level epidemic data is challenging, as we often only know when an individual's disease status was detected (e.g., when they showed symptoms) and not when they were infected or removed. We propose an autoregressive coupled hidden Markov model to infer unknown infection and removal times, as well as other model parameters, from a single observed detection time for each detected individual. Unlike more traditional data augmentation methods used in epidemic modelling, we do not assume that this detection time corresponds to infection or removal or that infected individuals must at some point be detected. Bayesian coupled hidden Markov models have been used previously for individual-level epidemic data. However, these approaches assumed each individual was continuously tested and that the tests were independent. In practice, individuals are often only tested until their first positive test, and even if they are continuously tested, only the initial detection times may be reported. In addition, multiple tests on the same individual may not be independent. We accommodate these scenarios by assuming that the probability of detecting the disease can depend on past observations, which allows us to fit a much wider range of practical applications. We illustrate the flexibility of our approach by fitting two examples: an experiment on the spread of tomato spot wilt virus in pepper plants and an outbreak of norovirus among nurses in a hospital.",

The onset of HD is marked by severe motor impairment, which may be predicted by prior cognitive decline and, in turn, exacerbate cognitive deficits. Clinical data, however, are often collected at discrete time points, so the timing of disease onset is subject to interval censoring. To address the challenges posed by such data, we develop a joint model for multivariate longitudinal biomarkers with a change point anchored at an interval-censored event time. The model simultaneously assesses the effects of longitudinal biomarkers on the event time and the changes in biomarker trajectories following the event. We conduct a comprehensive simulation study to demonstrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method for causal inference. Finally, we apply the method to PREDICT-HD, a multisite observational cohort study of prodromal HD individuals, to ascertain how cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction interact during disease progression.",

In signed networks, both edge connection patterns and edge signs are informative, and structural balance theory (e.g., triangles aligned with ``the enemy of my enemy is my friend'' and ``the friend of my friend is my friend'' are more prevalent) provides a global higher-order principle that guides community formation. We propose a Balanced Stochastic Block Model (BSBM), which incorporates balance theory into the network generating process such that balanced triangles are more likely to occur. We develop a fast profile pseudo-likelihood estimation algorithm with provable convergence and establish that our estimator achieves strong consistency under weaker signal conditions than methods for the binary SBM that rely solely on edge connectivity. Extensive simulation studies and two real-world signed networks demonstrate strong empirical performance.",

        "abstract": "Repeating an imperfect biomarker test based on an initial result can introduce bias and influence misclassification risk. For example, in some blood donation settings, blood donors' hemoglobin is remeasured when the initial measurement falls below a minimum threshold for donor eligibility. This paper explores methods that use data resulting from processes with conditionally repeated biomarker measurement to decompose the variation in observed measurements of a continuous biomarker into population variability and variability arising from the measurement procedure. We present two frequentist approaches with analytical solutions, but these approaches perform poorly in a dataset of conditionally repeated blood donor hemoglobin measurements where normality assumptions are not met. We then develop a Bayesian hierarchical framework that allows for different distributional assumptions, which we apply to the blood donor hemoglobin dataset. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model that assumes normally distributed population hemoglobin and heavy tailed $t$-distributed measurement variation, we found that the total measurement variation accounted for 22\\% of the total variance among females and 25\\% among males, with population standard deviations of $1.07\\, \\rm g/dL$ for female donors and $1.28\\, \\rm g/dL$ for male donors. Our Bayesian framework can use data resulting from any clinical process with conditionally repeated biomarker measurements to estimate individuals' misclassification risk after one or more noisy continuous measurements and inform evidence-based conditional retesting decision rules.",

        "abstract": "The research question we answer in this paper is whether the asymptotic distribution derived by Bai (2003) for Principal Components (PC) factors in dynamic factor models (DFMs) can approximate the empirical distribution of the sequential Least Squares (SLS) estimator of global and group-specific factors in multi-level dynamic factor models (ML-DFMs). Monte Carlo experiments confirm that under general forms of the idiosyncratic covariance matrix, the finite-sample distribution of SLS global and group-specific factors can be well approximated using the asymptotic distribution of PC factors. We also analyse the performance of alternative estimators of the asymptotic mean squared error (MSE) of the SLS factors and show that the MSE estimator that allows for idiosyncratic cross-sectional correlation and accounts for estimation uncertainty of factor loadings is best.",

Our approach consists in replacing exact vector-jacobian products by randomized, unbiased approximations thereof during backpropagation. We provide a theoretical analysis of the trade-off between the number of epochs needed to achieve a target precision and the cost reduction for each epoch. We then identify specific unbiased estimates of vector-jacobian products for which we establish desirable optimality properties of minimal variance under sparsity constraints. Finally we provide in-depth experiments on multi-layer perceptrons, BagNets and Visual Transfomers architectures. These validate our theoretical results, and confirm the potential of our proposed unbiased randomized backpropagation approach for reducing the cost of deep learning.",

We show that the joint chain inherits the convergence behavior of the marginal chain and conversely.

        "abstract": "Inverse problems and inverse design in multiphase media, i.e., recovering or engineering microstructures to achieve target macroscopic responses, require operating on discrete-valued material fields, rendering the problem non-differentiable and incompatible with gradient-based methods. Existing approaches either relax to continuous approximations, compromising physical fidelity, or employ separate heavyweight models for forward and inverse tasks. We propose GenPANIS, a unified generative framework that preserves exact discrete microstructures while enabling gradient-based inference through continuous latent embeddings. The model learns a joint distribution over microstructures and PDE solutions, supporting bidirectional inference (forward prediction and inverse recovery) within a single architecture. The generative formulation enables training with unlabeled data, physics residuals, and minimal labeled pairs. A physics-aware decoder incorporating a differentiable coarse-grained PDE solver preserves governing equation structure, enabling extrapolation to varying boundary conditions and microstructural statistics. A learnable normalizing flow prior captures complex posterior structure for inverse problems. Demonstrated on Darcy flow and Helmholtz equations, GenPANIS maintains accuracy on challenging extrapolative scenarios - including unseen boundary conditions, volume fractions, and microstructural morphologies, with sparse, noisy observations. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods while using 10 - 100 times fewer parameters and providing principled uncertainty quantification.",

While efficient algorithms for uniform polytope sampling exist, much less work has dealt with more complex constrained densities. In particular, gradient information as used in unconstrained MCMC is not necessarily helpful in the constrained case, where the gradient may push the proposal's density out of the polytope. In this work, we propose a novel constrained sampling algorithm, which combines strengths of higher-order information, like the target's log-density's gradients and curvature, with the Hit-&-Run proposal, a simple mechanism which guarantees the generation of feasible proposals, fulfilling the linear constraints. Our extensive experiments demonstrate improved sampling efficiency on complex constrained densities over various constrained and unconstrained samplers.",

In recent years, one such low-discrepancy construction method called subset selection has received a lot of attention. Given a large population, one optimally selects a small low-discrepancy subset with respect to a discrepancy-based objective. Versions of this problem are known to be NP-hard. In this text, we establish, for the first time, that the subset selection problem with respect to kernel discrepancies is also NP-hard. Motivated by this intractability, we propose a Bayesian Optimization procedure for the subset selection problem utilizing the recent notion of deep embedding kernels. We demonstrate the performance of the BO algorithm to minimize discrepancy measures and note that the framework is broadly applicable any design criteria.",

A \\emph{replicable online learning} algorithm is one that takes the same sequence of decisions across different executions in the same environment, with high probability. We initiate the study of algorithmic replicability in \\emph{constrained} MAB problems, where a learner interacts with an unknown stochastic environment for $T$ rounds, seeking not only to maximize reward but also to satisfy multiple constraints. Our main result is that replicability can be achieved in constrained MABs. Specifically, we design replicable algorithms whose regret and constraint violation match those of non-replicable ones in terms of $T$. As a key step toward these guarantees, we develop the first replicable UCB-like algorithm for \\emph{unconstrained} MABs, showing that algorithms that employ the optimism in-the-face-of-uncertainty principle can be replicable, a result that we believe is of independent interest.",

        "abstract": "We study the constrained variant of the \\emph{multi-armed bandit} (MAB) problem, in which the learner aims not only at minimizing the total loss incurred during the learning dynamic, but also at controlling the violation of multiple \\emph{unknown} constraints, under both \\emph{full} and \\emph{bandit feedback}. We consider a non-stationary environment that subsumes both stochastic and adversarial models and where, at each round, both losses and constraints are drawn from distributions that may change arbitrarily over time. In such a setting, it is provably not possible to guarantee both sublinear regret and sublinear violation. Accordingly, prior work has mainly focused either on settings with stochastic constraints or on relaxing the benchmark with fully adversarial constraints (\\emph{e.g.}, via competitive ratios with respect to the optimum). We provide the first algorithms that achieve optimal rates of regret and \\emph{positive} constraint violation when the constraints are stochastic while the losses may vary arbitrarily, and that simultaneously yield guarantees that degrade smoothly with the degree of adversariality of the constraints. Specifically, under \\emph{full feedback} we propose an algorithm attaining $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T}+C)$ regret and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T}+C)$ {positive} violation, where $C$ quantifies the amount of non-stationarity in the constraints. We then show how to extend these guarantees when only bandit feedback is available for the losses. Finally, when \\emph{bandit feedback} is available for the constraints, we design an algorithm achieving $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T}+C)$ {positive} violation and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T}+C\\sqrt{T})$ regret.",

We show that the variance inflation commonly assumed in existing analyses of GP-TS can be interpreted as Thompson Sampling with respect to a fractional posterior with tempering parameter $α\\in (0,1)$. We derive a kernel-agnostic regret bound expressed in terms of the information gain parameter $γ_t$ and the posterior contraction rate $ε_t$, and identify conditions on the Gaussian process prior under which $ε_t$ can be controlled. As special cases of our general bound, we recover regret of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{\\frac{1}{2}})$ for the squared exponential kernel, $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{\\frac{2ν+3d}{2(2ν+d)}} )$ for the Matérn-$ν$ kernel, and a bound of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{\\frac{2ν+3d}{2(2ν+d)}})$ for the rational quadratic kernel. Overall, our analysis provides a unified and discretization-free regret framework for GP-TS that applies broadly across kernel classes.",

This coupling renders models vulnerable to outliers and heavy-tailed noise. We propose CAIRO (Calibrate After Initial Rank Ordering), a framework that decouples regression into two distinct stages. In the first stage, we learn a scoring function by minimizing a scale-invariant ranking loss; in the second, we recover the target scale via isotonic regression. We theoretically characterize a class of \"Optimal-in-Rank-Order\" objectives -- including variants of RankNet and Gini covariance -- and prove that they recover the ordering of the true conditional mean under mild assumptions. We further show that subsequent monotone calibration guarantees recovery of the true regression function. Empirically, CAIRO combines the representation learning of neural networks with the robustness of rank-based statistics. It matches the performance of state-of-the-art tree ensembles on tabular benchmarks and significantly outperforms standard regression objectives in regimes with heavy-tailed or heteroskedastic noise.",

        "abstract": "Activation outliers in large-scale transformer models pose a fundamental challenge to model quantization, creating excessively large ranges that cause severe accuracy drops during quantization. We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale (e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2). Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Data augmentation is one of the most widely used techniques to improve generalization in modern machine learning, often justified by its ability to promote invariance to label-irrelevant transformations. However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap.",

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), in which household surveys provide the most reliable and timely source of data, SAE is vital for highlighting disparities in health and demographic indicators. Weighted estimators are ideal for inference, but for fine geographical partitions in which there are insufficient data, SAE models are required. The most common approach is Fay-Herriot area-level modeling in which the data requirements are a weighted estimate and an associated variance estimate. The latter can be undefined or unstable when data are sparse and so we propose a principled modification which is based on augmenting the available data with a prior sample from a hypothetical survey. This adjustment is generally available, respects the design and is simple to implement. We examine the empirical properties of the adjustment through simulation and illustrate its use with wasting data from a 2018 Zambian Demographic and Health Survey. The modification is implemented as an automatic remedy in the R package surveyPrev, which provides a comprehensive suite of tools for conducing SAE in LMICs.",

        "abstract": "When mutations are rampant, quasispecies theory or Eigen's model predicts that the fittest type in a population may not dominate. Beyond a critical mutation rate, the population may even be delocalized completely from the peak of the fitness landscape and the fittest is ironically lost. Extensive efforts have been made to understand this exceptional scenario. But in general, there is no simple prescription that predicts the eventual degree of localization for arbitrary fitness landscapes and mutation rates. Here, we derive a simple and general relation linking the quasispecies' Hill numbers, which are diversity metrics in ecology, and the ratio of an effective fitness variance to the mean mutation rate squared. This ratio, which we call the localization factor, emerges from mean approximations of decomposed surprisal or stochastic entropy change rates. On the side of application, the relation we obtained here defines a combination of Hill numbers that may complement other complexity or diversity measures for real viral quasispecies. Its advantage being that there is an underlying biological interpretation under Eigen's model.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial protocols - using substances such as antibiotics or disinfectants - remain the preferred option for preventing the spread of pathogenic bacteria. However, bacteria can develop mechanisms to reduce their antimicrobial susceptibility, which can lead to treatment failure and the selection of resistance or tolerance. In this work, we propose a minimal population dynamics model to study bacterial selection during cyclic antimicrobial application, a commonly used protocol. Selection in bacterial populations with heterogeneous antimicrobial susceptibility is modelled here as a trade-off between survival advantage (reduction in antimicrobial killing) and potential fitness costs (reduction in growth rate) of the less susceptible strains. The proposed model allows us to derive useful expressions for determining the success of cyclic antimicrobial treatments based on two bacterial traits: growth and kill rates. The results obtained here are directly applicable to preventing the selection and spread of resistant and tolerant bacterial strains in real-life protocols.",

In particular, edges appear and disappear over time depending on the states of the two connected vertices, on how long they have been infected, and on the total density of susceptible and infected vertices. Our main results establish functional laws of large numbers for the densities of susceptible, infected, and recovered vertices, jointly with the underlying evolving random graphs in the graphon space. Our results are supported by simulations, which characterize the limiting size of the epidemics, i.e., the limiting density of susceptible vertices, and how the peak of the epidemics depends on the rate of the evolution of the underlying graph. The proofs of our main results rely on the careful construction of a mimicking process, obtained by approximating the two-way feedback interaction between vertex and edge dynamics with a mean-field type interaction, acting only as one-way feedback, that remains sufficiently close to the original co-evolutionary process. To treat the more general setting in which edge dynamics are affected by the proportions of susceptible and infected individuals, we introduce a methodological extension of existing techniques. We thus show that our model exhibits multiple epidemic peaks -- a phenomenon observed in real-world epidemics -- which can emerge in models that incorporate mutual feedback between vertex and edge dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Multi-static backscatter networks (BNs) are strong candidates for joint communication and localization in the ambient IoT paradigm for 6G. Enabling real-time localization in large-scale multi-static deployments with thousands of devices require highly efficient algorithms for estimating key parameters such as range and angle of arrival (AoA), and for fusing these parameters into location estimates. We propose two low-complexity algorithms, Joint Range-Angle Clustering (JRAC) and Stage-wise Range-Angle Estimation (SRAE). Both deliver range and angle estimation accuracy comparable to FFT- and subspace-based baselines while significantly reducing the computation. We then introduce two real-time localization algorithms that fuse the estimated ranges and AoAs: a maximum-likelihood (ML) method solved via gradient search and an iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) method. Both achieve localization accuracy comparable to ML-based brute force search albeit with far lower complexity. Experiments on a real-world large-scale multi-static testbed with 4 illuminators, 1 multi-antenna receiver, and 100 tags show that JRAC and SRAE reduce runtime by up to 40X and IRLS achieves up to 500X reduction over ML-based brute force search without degrading localization accuracy. The proposed methods achieve 3 m median localization error across all 100 tags in a sub-6GHz band with 40 MHz bandwidth. These results demonstrate that multi-static range-angle estimation and localization algorithms can make real-time, scalable backscatter localization practical for next-generation ambient IoT networks.",

By leveraging the strong electromechanical coupling of XBARs in P3F TFLN together with the inherently wideband nature of the lattice topology, 3-dB fractional bandwidths (FBWs) of 27.42\\% and 39.11\\% and low insertion losses (ILs) of 0.88 dB and 0.96 dB are achieved at approximately 20 GHz for the direct and layout-balanced lattice filters, respectively, under conjugate matching. Notably, all prototypes feature compact footprints smaller than 1.3 mm\\textsuperscript{2}. These results highlight the potential of XBAR-based lattice architectures to enable low-loss, wideband acoustic filters for compact, high-performance RF front ends in next-generation wireless communication and sensing systems, while also identifying key challenges and directions for further optimization.",

Motivated by large-scale and networked systems where only selected linear combinations of the state are of interest, this paper studies functional generalisations of these properties. A PBH-style framework for functional system properties is developed, providing necessary and sufficient spectral characterisations. The results apply uniformly to diagonalizable and non-diagonalizable systems and recover the classical PBH tests as special cases. Two new intrinsic notions are introduced: intrinsic functional controllability, and intrinsic functional stabilizability. These intrinsic properties are formulated directly in terms of invariant subspaces associated with the functional and provide verifiable conditions for the existence of admissible augmentations required for functional controller design and observer-based functional controller design. The intrinsic framework enables the generalized separation principle at the functional level, establishing that functional controllers and functional observers can be designed independently. Illustrative examples demonstrate the theory and highlight situations where functional control and estimation are possible despite lack of full-state controllability or observability.",

        "abstract": "With the ongoing transition of electricity markets worldwide from hourly to intra-hourly bidding, market participants--especially Renewable Energy Sources (RES)--gain improved opportunities to adjust energy and reserve schedules and to benefit from more accurate higher-resolution forecasts. However, this shift requires participants to update decision-making frameworks and to strengthen uncertainty management in order to fully exploit the new market potential. In particular, Renewable-Based Virtual Power Plants (RVPPs) aggregating dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES must account for these changes through market-oriented scheduling methods that efficiently address multiple uncertainties, including electricity prices, RES generation, and demand consumption. In this vein, this paper proposes a multi-bound robust optimization framework to simultaneously capture these uncertainties, explicitly incorporate intra-hourly variability, and differentiate the deviation levels (frequent, moderate deviations and rare, extreme ones) of uncertain parameters. The proposed approach yields less conservative and more implementable bidding and scheduling decisions, thus improving RVPP profitability in both energy and reserve markets. Simulation studies compare the proposed method with standard robust optimization and evaluate the operational, market-strategy, and economic impacts of quarter-hourly versus hourly market resolution. Results indicate that the normalized absolute differences, across different uncertainty-handling strategies, between hourly and 15-minute schedules are 18.0--34.2% for day-ahead traded energy, and 28.7--65.6% and 10.1--16.3% for upward and downward reserve traded in the secondary reserve market, respectively. Furthermore, relative to classic robust optimization, the proposed multi-bound approach increases profit by 24.9--49.2% across the considered strategies.",

Relying on nested primary andsecondary control loops; a (distributed) outer-loop and a (decentralized) inner-loop, the controller achieves proportional current sharing among all distributed generation units, while dynamically operating within predefined voltage limits. A rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis establishes a scalable global exponential stability certificate under some tuning conditions and sufficient time-scale separation between the control loops, based on singular perturbation theory. An optimization-based tuning strategy is then formulated to identify and subsequently diminish unstable operating conditions. In turn, various practical tuning strategies are introduced to provide stable operations while facilitating near-optimal proportional current sharing. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework and tuning approaches are finally supported through time-domain simulations of a case-specific low-voltage DC microgrid.",

Unlike conventional deep learning methods that rely on large, supervised datasets, the DIP exploits the implicit bias of convolutional neural networks and operates in a fully unsupervised setting, requiring only a single measurement, even in the presence of noise. We describe the standard DIP formulation, outline key algorithmic design choices, and review several strategies to mitigate overfitting, including early stopping, explicit regularisation, and self-guided methods that adapt the network input. In addition, we examine computational improvements such as warm-start and stochastic optimisation methods to reduce the reconstruction time. The discussed methods are tested on real $μ$CT measurements, which allows examination of trade-offs among the different modifications and extensions.",

While it is well known that high creak probability is typically correlated with low pitch, it is important to note that this is a property observed on a population of speakers but does not necessarily hold across all situations. Disentanglement of pitch from creak is achieved by augmentation of the training dataset of a speech synthesis system with a speaker manipulation block based on conditional continuous normalizing flow. The experiments show greatly improved speaker verification performance over a range of creak manipulation strengths.",

This paper systematically investigates data augmentation (DA) strategies to improve SE performance for pathological speakers, evaluating both predictive and generative SE models. We examine three DA categories, i.e., transformative, generative, and noise augmentation, assessing their impact with objective SE metrics. Experimental results show that noise augmentation consistently delivers the largest and most robust gains, transformative augmentations provide moderate improvements, while generative augmentation yields limited benefits and can harm performance as the amount of synthetic data increases. Furthermore, we show that the effectiveness of DA varies depending on the SE model, with DA being more beneficial for predictive SE models. While our results demonstrate that DA improves SE performance for pathological speakers, a performance gap between neurotypical and pathological speech persists, highlighting the need for future research on targeted DA strategies for pathological speech.",

        "abstract": "Proximity operations of rigid bodies, such as spacecraft rendezvous and docking, require precise tracking of both position and attitude over finite time intervals. These operations are often repeated under uncertain conditions, with unknown but repeatable parameters and disturbances. Adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) is well suited to such tasks, as it can track desired trajectories while learning unknown, iteration-invariant signals or parameters. However, conventional adaptive ILC faces two challenges: (i) the coupling between rotational and translational dynamics complicates the design of the two coordinated learning loops for position and attitude, and (ii) standard adaptive ILC designs cannot guarantee bounded control inputs. To address these issues, we propose a dual-number-based, segment-based two-loop adaptive ILC framework for simultaneous high-precision position and attitude tracking. The framework employs two learning loops that interact through a dual-number representation of tracking errors, combining position and attitude errors into a single mathematical object for unified control design. A segment-based dynamic projection mechanism ensures that both parameter estimates and control inputs remain bounded without prior knowledge of uncertainties. Mathematical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances tracking performance under unknown but repeatable uncertainties and strong rotational-translational coupling.",

This article introduces the principles of SAC for direct satellite-to-device uplink, showcasing precise direction-of-arrival estimation for user equipment (UE) devices, facilitating spatial signal separation, localization, and easing link budget constraints. Simulations for a low Earth orbit satellite at 600 km orbit and two UE devices performing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based transmission with polar coding at 3.5 GHz demonstrate block error rates below 0.1 with transmission powers as low as -10 dBm, even under strong interference when UE devices are resolved but fall on each other's strongest angular sidelobe. These results validate the ability of the proposed scheme to address mutual interference and stringent power limitations, paving the way for massive Internet of Things connectivity in non-terrestrial networks.",

        "abstract": "Long-duration audio is increasingly common in industrial and consumer settings, yet reviewing multi-hour recordings is impractical, motivating systems that answer natural-language queries with precise temporal grounding and minimal hallucination. Existing audio-language models show promise, but long-audio question answering remains difficult due to context-length limits. We introduce LongAudio-RAG (LA-RAG), a hybrid framework that grounds Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in retrieved, timestamped acoustic event detections rather than raw audio. Multi-hour streams are converted into structured event records stored in an SQL database, and at inference time the system resolves natural-language time references, classifies intent, retrieves only the relevant events, and generates answers using this constrained evidence. To evaluate performance, we construct a synthetic long-audio benchmark by concatenating recordings with preserved timestamps and generating template-based question-answer pairs for detection, counting, and summarization tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach by deploying it in a hybrid edge-cloud environment, where the audio grounding model runs on-device on IoT-class hardware while the LLM is hosted on a GPU-backed server. This architecture enables low-latency event extraction at the edge and high-quality language reasoning in the cloud. Experiments show that structured, event-level retrieval significantly improves accuracy compared to vanilla Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or text-to-SQL approaches.",

Its eigenmodes define a spectral representation that inherently captures cross-domain interactions, in contrast to conventional Hodge-Laplacian eigenmodes that operate within a single topological dimension. In this paper, we compare the two alternatives in terms of the distortion/sparsity trade-off and we show how an overcomplete basis built concatenating the two dictionaries can provide better performance with respect to each approach. Then, we propose a parameterized nonredundant transform whose eigenmodes incorporate a mode-specific mass parameter that captures the interplay between node and edge modes. Interestingly, we show that learning the mass parameters from data makes the proposed transform able to achieve the best distortion-sparsity tradeoff with respect to both complete and overcomplete bases.",

This may be interpreted as finding an autoregressive representative for sets of second-order stationary Gaussian processes. While Wasserstein, or optimal transport, barycenters have been successfully used earlier in problems of spectral estimation and clustering, the resulting barycenters are non-parametric and the complexity of representing and storing them depends on, e.g., the choice of discretization grid. In contrast, the herein proposed method yields compact, low-dimensional, and interpretable spectral centroids that can be used in downstream tasks. Computing the all-pole centroids corresponds to solving a non-convex optimization problem in the model parameters, and we present a gradient descent scheme for addressing this. Although convergence to a globally optimal point cannot be guaranteed, the sub-optimality of the obtained centroids can be quantified. The proposed method is illustrated on a problem of phoneme classification.",

In this paper, we establish sufficient and necessary conditions under which a controlled nonlinear system admits an exact finite-dimensional Koopman linear representation, which we term Koopman linear embedding. We show that such a system must be transformable into a special control-affine preserved (CAP) structure, which enforces affine dependence of the state on the control input and isolates all nonlinearities into an autonomous subsystem. We further prove that this autonomous subsystem must itself admit a finite-dimensional Koopman linear model with a sufficiently-rich Koopman invariant subspace. Finally, we introduce a symbolic procedure to determine whether a given controlled nonlinear system admits the CAP structure, thereby elucidating whether Koopman approximation errors arise from intrinsic system dynamics or from the choice of lifting functions.",

The hybrid gain structure ensures bounded control effort while retaining finite time convergence, and the incorporation of PPFs enables explicit enforcement of transient performance requirements. Theoretical guarantees are first established for first order systems, characterizing finite time convergence, disturbance rejection, and residual bounds. The approach is then extended to second order dynamics, where a sliding manifold is designed using PPF constraints to facilitate controlled shaping of position and velocity transients. Simulation studies illustrate the proposed design under matched peak control conditions. Comparative results for second-order systems demonstrate that, while a well tuned non-PPF hybrid gain controller achieves competitive tracking performance, the PPF-aware formulation strictly enforces prescribed transient constraints and yields consistent reductions of approximately 9 to 12 percent in integral error and control energy metrics without increasing peak actuation effort.",

        "abstract": "We compute general compatibility conditions between a weakly nonlocal homogeneous Hamiltonian operator and a third-order homogeneous Hamiltonian operator. Such operators determine a bi-Hamiltonian structure for many integrable PDEs (Korteweg--De Vries, Camassa--Holm, dispersive water waves, Dym, WDVV and others). Remarkably, the full set of conditions is purely algebraic and the first-order operator is completely determined by commuting systems of conservation laws that are Hamiltonian with respect to a third-order operator. We illustrate the above results with several examples, some of which, concerning WDVV equations, are new.",
