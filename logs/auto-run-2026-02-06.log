`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The integrated report skeleton template (in Korean) demonstrates a sophisticated dual-workflow pattern where:
1. **Unified pSST Ranking** - Combines signals from both workflows using a weighted scoring system that normalizes different source types
2. **Cross-Workflow Analysis** - Identifies three key patterns: reinforced signals (appearing in both), academic-early signals (WF2 leads), and media-first signals (WF1 leads)
3. **STEEPs Balance** - The integrated top 15 shows T(7), P(3), E(2), s(2) distribution, reflecting technological and political signals dominating current environment

## Daily Scan Execution Complete

The dual workflow environmental scanning system for **2026-02-06** has been successfully completed. Here is the summary:

### Execution Summary

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Step 0: SOT Validation** | PASS | 13/13 checks passed (manual validation) |
| **Step 1: WF1 General Scan** | COMPLETE | 52 signals from 18 sources, avg pSST 76.8 |
| **Step 2: WF2 arXiv Scan** | COMPLETE | 35 signals from 32 arXiv categories, avg pSST 74.2 |
| **Step 3: Integration** | COMPLETE | Top 15 unified ranking (10 WF1 + 5 WF2) |

### Top 5 Integrated Signals

| Rank | Origin | Title | Category | pSST |
|------|--------|-------|----------|------|
| 1 | WF1 | Trump Executive Order - Federal AI Framework | P | 94 |
| 2 | WF1 | WEF Global Risks 2026 - Geoeconomic Confrontation | P | 93 |
| 3 | WF1 | Physical AI Dominates CES 2026 | T | 92 |
| 4 | WF2 | MaxRL: 20x Test-Time Scaling Efficiency | T | 91 |
| 5 | WF1 | Google Willow Quantum Chip - Error Reduction | T | 91 |

### Cross-Workflow Patterns Identified

1. **Quantum Computing Maturation** - Hardware breakthroughs (WF1: Google Willow) validated by academic reviews (WF2: Superconducting Qubit Review)
2. **AI Governance Transition** - Regulatory actions (WF1: Trump EO) aligned with academic safety frameworks (WF2: AI Safety Benchmarks)
3. **Physical AI Emergence** - Market validation (WF1: CES 2026, Waabi $750M) supported by embodied AI research (WF2: LLM planning papers)
